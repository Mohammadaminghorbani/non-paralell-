p225_001|please call stella.
p225_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p225_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p225_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p225_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p225_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p225_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p225_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p225_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p225_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p225_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p225_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p225_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p225_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p225_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p225_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p225_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p225_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p225_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p225_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p225_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p225_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p225_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p225_025|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p225_026|how are you sir ?
p225_027|so is that it then ?
p225_028|do i have a favourite ?
p225_029|what do we do ?
p225_030|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p225_033|it's really no great surprise because the price difference is so much.
p225_035|a hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
p225_036|it was a close call.
p225_037|in fact they are the future of investment.
p225_038|diving is no part of football.
p225_039|however the decision has been welcomed by scottish enterprise officials.
p225_040|you'd better believe it.
p225_044|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p225_045|people were determined to change the government in the last election.
p225_046|no details of the talks were given.
p225_049|i have learned from him.
p225_051|we are committed to the ban.
p225_052|already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p225_053|i have made that offer.
p225_054|four other charges were dropped.
p225_056|clearly it can go either way.
p225_057|however the city was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p225_058|however the problem is the timing.
p225_059|but retail banking would be run from halifax.
p225_060|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p225_061|saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p225_062|i was very pleased with them today though.
p225_063|both sides have been hit by injury.
p225_064|it could take some time.
p225_065|there is no pressure on us.
p225_066|it is a job creation scheme.
p225_067|thankfully mr campbell was able to help.
p225_070|that is bound to happen.
p225_071|he is in the queue.
p225_072|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p225_073|so did she meet him ?
p225_081|i had no intention of misleading anyone.
p225_082|that view is held by many others within the industry.
p225_083|western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p225_084|he is delighted and he has every right to be.
p225_086|in fact he should never have been in the field.
p225_089|officers recovered a second body in the area.
p225_090|i did not have a bet on myself.
p225_092|there is a contract in existence for allan.
p225_094|that's as it should be.
p225_103|everyone deserves to share in this success.
p225_104|his is a success story by any standard.
p225_108|mr chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p225_109|that might help a bit.
p225_110|thereafter he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p225_111|it isn't a happy memory.
p225_113|the big issue for us is the review.
p225_114|i told him i was a long time ago.
p225_115|overall it was a promising day for the scots.
p225_116|yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p225_117|we have no influence on the government's policy on the euro.
p225_118|we suffered a lot for seven years.
p225_120|the industry is not well organised.
p225_121|you get a lot for your money.
p225_122|i didn't feel under any pressure.
p225_123|it is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p225_124|as for the warning it was not needed.
p225_126|the squad is too small.
p225_127|it is a common problem.
p225_128|mr hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p225_131|another high street retailer was not so lucky.
p225_133|i think he's the favourite.
p225_135|we have seen a copy of the report.
p225_136|but the commission is on a collision course with the government.
p225_141|drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p225_142|well you can have a tree.
p225_143|russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p225_144|she will do for me.
p225_145|why change it ?
p225_147|does the name matter ?
p225_149|shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p225_150|but he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p225_151|nothing has been put into action.
p225_152|the weather forecast isn't good.
p225_153|we have a clean bill of health.
p225_156|i would like to see the figures for the second quarter.
p225_157|he was asked to quit.
p225_158|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p225_159|neither side can win this war.
p225_165|the internet is no substitute for customer service.
p225_166|like last month it is simply too early to make a call.
p225_169|irvine said his company was intent on supporting the scottish dairy industry.
p225_171|the report was criticised by the scottish consumer council.
p225_172|nobody did in those days.
p225_173|but the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
p225_174|he was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
p225_175|at that point the structure of the board was changed.
p225_176|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p225_177|the event was held in the council's headquarters in hamilton.
p225_179|they know no other way.
p225_182|we are just glad to be alive.
p225_191|people will ask about us.
p225_192|however this idea is never developed.
p225_193|it's very difficult to find a buyer.
p225_195|it is hard to tell.
p225_196|i think therefore i am ?
p225_197|who was she ?
p225_199|and they were being paid ?
p225_200|it looked like a river.
p225_201|the early goal was a shock to the system for hearts.
p225_202|the occasion was the new labour conference in brighton last year.
p225_203|they have the cash and the fire power.
p225_208|you are a great player.
p225_210|scotland will play its part.
p225_211|he added that he was very sad about o neill.
p225_212|after that nothing could save him.
p225_218|we used to live with dignity in our country.
p225_219|they did not attack the themes of the book.
p225_220|he would discuss the peace process in northern ireland.
p225_221|it's all change at kilmarnock.
p225_222|in each case they were a goal down.
p225_223|the police have an awful lot to explain.
p225_224|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p225_225|it is good for our team.
p225_235|i always felt that i was in control of the match.
p225_236|that will be the criteria for the future.
p225_237|frankly we were lucky to get second.
p225_238|paterson can afford to be generous.
p225_239|in fact he is not even in the squad for the game.
p225_240|we are in the hat.
p225_241|well they were the unlucky ones.
p225_242|the singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p225_243|the irony was not lost.
p225_244|what was the matter for concern ?
p225_248|does that put pressure on us ?
p225_253|clearly the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p225_254|the problem was a social problem.
p225_257|my son was too young to die.
p225_258|we were not allowed to go to help them.
p225_264|that should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p225_265|it was a budget for jobs for scotland.
p225_266|no other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p225_268|i realised i was lucky to have it.
p225_273|he has not created a festival resource.
p225_274|we have not reached the point of no return.
p225_275|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p225_276|he will make an excellent chief inspector.
p225_277|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p225_279|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p225_280|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p225_281|they were not at the property yesterday.
p225_282|it was at the royal concert hall in glasgow.
p225_285|we have to break that cycle.
p225_286|i wanted to change the formula.
p225_287|she said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
p225_289|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p225_290|scotch beef is badly missed.
p225_291|we would hope to make progress on that next year.
p225_293|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p225_294|however we had no failures in our side.
p225_295|clydesdale bank declined to comment.
p225_296|it goes back a long way.
p225_297|innocent people have a right to live in safety.
p225_298|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p225_299|they had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p225_300|i can hardly believe it.
p225_301|i must do something about it.
p225_302|three hours later the man was free.
p225_303|and it had been a marvellous occasion.
p225_305|cast away now on general release.
p225_308|i thought his speech was a disgrace.
p225_309|are they free ?
p225_310|what are they for ?
p225_312|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p225_314|we believe the world has too many refugees already.
p225_315|the confidence is low but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p225_316|it is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
p225_317|at the moment it is very difficult to know.
p225_318|the problem was he thought you were a big man.
p225_319|there's still a bit to go.
p225_320|we have a good healthy debate.
p225_322|funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p225_323|it is a court case.
p225_324|there is no plan b.
p225_325|the court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p225_326|he will go a long way.
p225_328|it is just a tax on employment.
p225_329|there is no other solution to congestion in edinburgh.
p225_330|we are a peaceful people.
p225_331|ms anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p225_332|it's difficult to predict the future.
p225_334|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p225_335|we are in the end game.
p225_336|i came into this world with nothing.
p225_337|but they have the sound.
p225_346|it wasn't a flight of fancy.
p225_347|boy is the town a mess.
p225_348|does it matter ?
p225_349|how do you take them away ?
p225_350|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p225_351|after the match do you ?
p225_352|he was then replaced by ross.
p225_353|the pain was almost too much to bear.
p225_354|this action reflects a slump in bookings.
p225_355|her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p225_356|i said he was set to retire.
p225_357|it is a sign of hope.
p225_358|the commitment was not long and it was worth the risk.
p225_359|but we welcome this document.
p225_363|there is the beautiful game to write.
p225_365|you did not see it.
p225_366|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p226_001|please call stella.
p226_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p226_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p226_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p226_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p226_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p226_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p226_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p226_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p226_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p226_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p226_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p226_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p226_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p226_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p226_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p226_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p226_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p226_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p226_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p226_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p226_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p226_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p226_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p226_025|he has not been named.
p226_026|that's no bad thing.
p226_027|they should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p226_028|suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p226_029|we want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p226_030|because we do not need it.
p226_031|this is the window.
p226_032|i was an athlete.
p226_033|from that day on we started to look for another full back.
p226_034|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p226_036|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p226_037|it is a matter of the utmost concern to the allies.
p226_039|it has failed.
p226_040|it was clear.
p226_041|it is not for any other purpose.
p226_042|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p226_043|is there a new way forward?
p226_044|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p226_045|this represents a tough game for us.
p226_046|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p226_047|we need to chat.
p226_048|it's a blessing.
p226_049|but it might have done.
p226_050|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p226_051|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p226_052|it is the whole package.
p226_053|he had no enemies.
p226_054|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p226_055|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p226_056|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p226_057|it's the big omission.
p226_058|next league matches celtic.
p226_059|she's a spy
p226_060|it is unique.
p226_061|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p226_062|this is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p226_063|it's a real challenge.
p226_064|it is not great art.
p226_065|you do not change overnight.
p226_066|art is extra.
p226_067|it's a matter of balance.
p226_068|scotland had great assets.
p226_069|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p226_070|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p226_071|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p226_072|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p226_073|the script was funny.
p226_074|you need a trademark.
p226_075|painful but only because it's true.
p226_076|help is needed.
p226_077|tommy is not a problem.
p226_078|there could be a way back.
p226_079|neither it is.
p226_080|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p226_082|it is a terrible place.
p226_083|it works for us.
p226_084|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p226_085|it can be halted.
p226_086|this is the way things should be handled.
p226_088|detection is often difficult.
p226_089|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p226_090|new zealand rugby is totally different.
p226_091|someone who cares
p226_092|it's just awful.
p226_093|it's never too late.
p226_094|every time i play i do not understand their reaction.
p226_095|that will come after the game on saturday.
p226_096|however it did not end that way.
p226_097|we could not get any possession.
p226_098|if you could find it.
p226_099|he is hungry for success and i am the same.
p226_100|they were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p226_101|it was mayhem.
p226_102|i am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p226_103|they were outside the circle.
p226_104|however the intensive care unit at the southern general hospital was full.
p226_105|may not have been at fault?
p226_106|it was some time before she found out he was safe.
p226_107|it was a good performance.
p226_108|that time is not now however.
p226_109|oil embargo endorsed.
p226_110|before the game we went for a pint.
p226_111|it was an adventure.
p226_112|the eye was badly closed on sunday.
p226_113|the prime minister was very saddened to hear about this.
p226_114|it was really enjoyable on saturday.
p226_115|i did not think about the ryder cup.
p226_116|it is normal.
p226_117|i don't have many friends.
p226_118|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p226_119|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p226_120|it would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p226_121|maybe this battle has been.
p226_122|mr chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p226_124|this is the first big idea of the scottish parliament election.
p226_125|she's got to say something.
p226_126|it is a delight on every level.
p226_127|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p226_128|i felt very strongly that england should have it.
p226_129|she has been shot.
p226_130|i thought it was a fantastic game.
p226_131|i was furious.
p226_132|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p226_133|she really suffered for her art.
p226_134|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p226_135|i do not think this family will ever get over this.
p226_136|wish i could be there on sunday in person but i can't.
p226_137|it will be too hot.
p226_138|the whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p226_139|i am now unemployed.
p226_140|they made such decisions in london.
p226_141|our intentions are real.
p226_142|government will intervene.
p226_143|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p226_144|police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p226_145|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p226_146|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p226_148|three penalties were given.
p226_149|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p226_150|we just had a go.
p226_151|we have seen a copy of the report.
p226_152|that could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p226_153|that group reported just before christmas.
p226_154|initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p226_155|it's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p226_156|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p226_157|alain baxter did not have long to speak on friday.
p226_158|we will turn the corner.
p226_159|the weather affected the other two games in fife.
p226_160|they should stop the bombing.
p226_161|these days are long gone.
p226_162|it is an attitude of mind.
p226_163|i've learned from my mistakes.
p226_164|they say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p226_165|we have to move forward.
p226_166|however the french government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p226_167|they will do their own thing.
p226_168|it is too much for me.

p226_242|it's only fair.
p226_243|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.

p226_339|my view has now completely changed.
p226_340|you can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p226_341|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p226_342|three years ago he would have been.
p226_343|i'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p226_344|he also insisted that no concessions had been made to the french.
p226_345|they made clear that they are not interested in government assistance.
p226_346|but the disease has not been confined to the tory party.
p226_347|it was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p226_348|look at the witnesses.
p226_349|he's been the key to everything.
p226_350|that is the very reason why it was so vital.
p226_351|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p226_352|his contract was then not renewed.
p226_353|a report is the first step in a criminal case in india.
p226_354|that is a break with tradition.
p226_355|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p226_356|she is free.
p226_357|i kept going for her.
p226_358|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p226_359|he's very explosive.

p226_370|saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p227_001|please call stella.
p227_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p227_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.

p227_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p227_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p227_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p227_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p227_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p227_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p227_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p227_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p227_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p227_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
p227_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p227_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p227_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p227_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p227_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p227_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p227_025|meetings will also remain private.
p227_026|movement has to take place.
p227_027|i feel i did not have enough time.
p227_028|we will look into it.
p227_029|this is a central issue.
p227_030|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p227_031|the premier league has been a huge success.
p227_032|there you were just a body.
p227_033|it is not for any other purpose.
p227_034|president bush is at war.
p227_035|i became a widow overnight.
p227_036|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p227_037|this represents a tough game for us.

p227_039|among them are many criminals.
p227_040|yesterday he was busy in his office.
p227_041|he looks like an afghan.
p227_042|it will concentrate on the thames valley.
p227_043|i'd come back from london.
p227_044|if i was a woman.
p227_045|he was a home referee.
p227_046|there was no safety net.
p227_047|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p227_048|we have to look beyond the very short term.
p227_049|i expect a rapid response.
p227_050|that is very hard alone.
p227_051|the motive for the shooting was not known.
p227_052|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p227_053|four other charges were dropped.

p227_059|what do we do ?
p227_060|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p227_061|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p227_062|they have to come up with a solution.
p227_063|we will pay their bills.
p227_064|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p227_065|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p227_066|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p227_067|i have proved that in the past.
p227_068|he had been a singer.
p227_069|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p227_070|then followed a bout of flu.
p227_071|both sides have been hit by injury.
p227_072|halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p227_073|it is a terrible place.
p227_074|even the one she loved.
p227_075|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p227_076|there may be reasons for it.
p227_077|i first met him last summer.
p227_078|last week he was taken into hospital.
p227_079|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p227_080|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p227_081|by then he was walking on water.
p227_082|we have to offer value for money.
p227_083|they lived for their children.
p227_084|potions said he would drive.
p227_085|the latter is due to be finished in february.

p227_087|the outsourcing deal will take effect in september.
p227_088|we will deal with the refugees.
p227_089|you might not make it.
p227_090|it is open season on the old firm.
p227_091|that is the important thing.
p227_092|for once you should believe the hype.
p227_093|clark was desperate to return to the house of commons.
p227_094|their attitude is all wrong.
p227_095|you are like an animal.
p227_096|no the equipment is extra.
p227_097|the following are the principal provisions.
p227_098|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p227_099|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p227_100|i had a fortunate war.
p227_101|i did not see any reason to change the captain.
p227_102|saddam hussein is a devil.
p227_103|it was never a starter.
p227_104|and the match was not too bad either.
p227_105|such actions are rarely popular.
p227_106|it is safe in our hands.
p227_107|then came the farewell to europe.
p227_108|it is much as it has been described.
p227_109|you can spend money on housing.
p227_110|that admission is not surprising.
p227_111|not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p227_112|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p227_113|however we have to be cautious.
p227_114|but we could only help a handful of people.
p227_116|it is just a tax on employment.
p227_117|this should begin in october.
p227_118|my life has changed a lot.
p227_119|we did what we had to do.
p227_120|why do it otherwise ?
p227_121|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p227_122|so did she meet him ?
p227_123|so what is the campaign about ?
p227_124|and does it ?
p227_125|you've got to be vigilant.
p227_126|we are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
p227_127|any success would have been an improvement.
p227_128|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p227_129|and i have some advice for my old friend.
p227_130|he is a great addition to our team.
p227_131|however this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
p227_132|i felt he was excellent.
p227_133|they could use a boost.
p227_134|it is a vicious circle.
p227_135|we could easily have lost that game.
p227_136|this is a limited market.
p227_137|our position is quite simple.
p227_138|five minutes later the home team were back in front.
p227_139|their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p227_140|drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p227_141|he's not a celtic man.
p227_142|it opens the door to the champions league.
p227_143|so i got a blood test.
p227_144|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p227_145|these men are a part of india.
p227_146|like the others he was arrested.
p227_147|there's only one team in ayrshire.
p227_148|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p227_149|that was the difference between the sides.
p227_150|charles gordon leader of glasgow city council declined to comment.
p227_151|i was shaking on the blocks.
p227_152|she had gone to the catholic school.
p227_153|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p227_154|the strong pound also took its toll.
p227_155|it was a funny feeling.
p227_156|i'd love to be like peter.
p227_157|adams is surely worth a chance.
p227_158|it is difficult to say.
p227_159|he was in great spirits.
p227_160|seven people were later detained by police.
p227_161|they want to see him.
p227_162|next year it plans to open an office in tokyo.
p227_163|nobody did in those days.
p227_164|there is no signature on this document.
p227_165|we've made a couple of albums.
p227_166|what happened in that game ?
p227_167|are you going to win ?
p227_168|was it the wife ?
p227_169|why change it ?
p227_170|what do we want to do that for ?
p227_171|the people are the hero.
p227_172|one season they might do well.
p227_173|they made such decisions in london.
p227_174|the second aspect was the fear of failure.
p227_175|the jury is still out.
p227_176|but he has a lifeline.
p227_177|the expansions will be financed by the clydesdale bank.
p227_178|i'm just going to hit the shot.
p227_179|it makes no influence on the public.
p227_180|that will apply to both sets of fans.
p227_181|i think it's a good sign.
p227_183|i have spoken to head office.
p227_184|well you can have a tree.
p227_186|they bought the property four years ago.
p227_187|he is believed to live in britain.
p227_188|we've just had it confirmed.
p227_189|a copy of the report will be sent to them.
p227_190|this is the time to use it.
p227_191|you know the sort of thing.
p227_192|they were seriously after him.
p227_193|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p227_194|trading conditions have not been that bad.
p227_195|i'm interested in interesting work.
p227_196|it will be reviewed in the herald tomorrow.
p227_197|the force is with them.
p227_198|if the director is with you.
p227_199|he made no order on costs.
p227_200|i guess i was lucky though.
p227_201|this year it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p227_203|it was served by sheriff officers.
p227_204|this will be our new beginning.
p227_205|they have the cash and the fire power.
p227_206|my heart is with the artist.
p227_207|that might mean another delay.
p227_208|however it is not as simple as this.
p227_209|the sanctions are about collective punishment.
p227_210|this is a holy place.
p227_211|does the name matter ?
p227_212|how do you get it back ?
p227_213|what are you not good at ?
p227_214|i think therefore i am ?
p227_215|who was she ?
p227_216|you have caught a serial killer.
p227_217|it seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p227_218|the move follows a review of the singapore
p227_219|they make a selective perception process.
p227_220|there is no quick fix.
p227_222|they have known the hard times.
p227_223|that might help a bit.
p227_226|i'm just a regular person.
p227_227|my daughter is an adult.
p227_228|he would discuss the peace process in northern ireland.
p227_229|it's just a normal life.
p227_230|he must get to know himself.
p227_231|and the world cup has not even begun.
p227_232|he remains a main board director of royal.
p227_233|the fight is under way.
p227_235|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p227_236|they all made the european ryder cup team.
p227_237|we can certainly build on this.
p227_238|william hague delighted his party.
p227_239|there is a world of difference.
p227_240|we played them off the pitch.
p227_241|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p227_242|i can't wait to meet him.
p227_243|my wife and family are the support system.
p227_244|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p227_245|it is the voice of the survivors.
p227_246|she died in middle age.
p227_247|it is set in paris.
p227_248|you will have seen the adverts.
p227_249|it is possible to be too good.
p227_250|moreover it must be for all sports.
p227_251|they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
p227_252|the irony was not lost.
p227_253|three weeks later he resigned.
p227_254|it is a court case.
p227_255|it might be sad but it's a fact.
p227_256|she took them for a term.
p227_257|kingfisher can afford to wait.
p227_258|nato was not a love affair.
p227_259|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p227_260|hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p227_261|you can feel at home in china.
p227_262|our decision making was poor.
p227_263|the calls were last night rejected by the us and the uk.
p227_264|the baby deserves the credit.
p227_265|and they were being paid ?
p227_266|was everything done to save people ?
p227_267|what was the matter for concern ?
p227_268|do i think about them often ?
p227_269|is it in the right place ?
p227_270|did he trip ?
p227_271|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p227_272|i should think so too.
p227_273|no production contract is yet in sight.
p227_274|the capital costs are modest.
p227_275|this is no reflection on rangers.
p227_276|i told you i was ill.
p227_277|i can't get a job.
p227_278|that could be in place by next year.
p227_279|on the contrary they stand to gain.
p227_280|blair is very positive at european councils.
p227_281|i rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p227_282|it does not work that way in scottish football.
p227_283|every one is a winner.
p227_284|there's not much money in cycling.
p227_285|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p227_286|not many companies can say that these days.
p227_287|they can leave at any time.
p227_288|you get a lot for your money.
p227_289|as for scotland we can just enjoy the moment.
p227_290|it would create a scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p227_291|it was an easy decision to come here.
p227_292|both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p227_293|he ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p227_294|but the plot is not the point.
p227_295|it was never a free kick.
p227_296|my body is a wreck.
p227_297|it's called the supreme court for a reason.
p227_298|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p227_299|she failed in her action.
p227_300|stephen will get his first cap.
p227_301|it's hard to see it.
p227_302|her appeal is to be heard this week.
p227_303|we have to be very very careful.
p227_304|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p227_305|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p227_306|it is an amazing response.
p227_307|size is not the issue.
p227_308|he will address the nation this evening.
p227_309|we have the easy part.
p227_310|we are not increasing the number.
p227_311|i'm looking for work in bath and back home in scotland.
p227_312|they do not reflect the quality of the brand.
p227_313|it could well be military.
p227_314|and that culture is everywhere in dublin.
p227_315|his job was not advertised.
p227_316|this is a big step up.
p227_317|it goes back a long way.
p227_318|the weather forecast isn't good.
p227_319|we have a clean bill of health.
p227_320|in that case the children were not missing.
p227_321|i have got a victim.
p227_322|the judge was really nice.
p227_323|if you can run a computer you can talk to the world.
p227_324|mcnaughton was not so sure.
p227_326|the dealer is on notice.
p227_327|it is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
p227_328|the party lasted all night.
p227_329|he would help me with the form.
p227_330|there's still a bit to go.
p227_331|i'm not worried about the critics.
p227_332|i would do away with the dress code.
p227_333|it is so easy to be negative.
p227_334|what form did that take ?
p227_335|are they free ?
p227_336|what are they for ?
p227_337|is there a waiting list ?
p227_338|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p227_339|so what happens next ?
p227_340|the result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p227_341|i am not obsessed with sex.
p227_342|have a look at this lot.
p227_343|that decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p227_344|public opinion was split on the proposal.
p227_345|the king is delighted by the honour.
p227_347|i've got a sense of humour too.
p227_348|in the old days it was easy.
p227_349|i came into this world with nothing.
p227_350|this is a trend which will be encouraged.
p227_351|there will have to be a full inquiry.
p227_352|there was no time scale.
p227_353|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p227_354|whether this return was too soon.
p227_355|the us open was very difficult but it was enjoyable.
p227_356|they were the acts of men.
p227_357|shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p227_358|of course we want to go home.
p227_359|i am very interested in the subject.
p227_360|he is not very big either.
p227_361|a report is expected next month.
p227_363|we are encouraged by the news.
p227_364|had this been common practice ?
p227_365|what do they want us to do ?
p227_366|is it worth it ?
p227_367|does it matter ?
p227_368|a crucial moment has arrived.
p227_369|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p227_370|we need to be prepared.
p227_371|not that scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p227_372|his views are hardly surprising.
p227_373|the announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p227_374|it has been made to entertain.
p227_375|it is a stroke of genius.
p227_376|italy was just behind the us.
p227_377|it was forced to divert.
p227_378|alex ferguson is the same.
p227_379|i would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p227_380|we are still getting over it.
p227_382|this will impact on us.
p227_383|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p227_384|he is in the queue.
p227_385|the salary changes are long overdue.
p227_386|i do not like to lose.
p227_387|i am a member of the labour party staff.
p227_388|there is no deal as yet.
p227_389|in due course the deal was done.
p227_390|celtic were pleased to help.
p227_391|they will fight for everything.
p227_392|that's not like us at all.
p227_393|you have to rely on each other.
p227_394|i wanted to go out on a high.
p227_395|i felt the head was very like me.
p227_396|it is a terrible equation.
p227_397|they have not got anyone.
p227_398|i can hardly believe it.
p227_399|how do you take them away ?
p227_400|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p227_401|after the match do you ?
p227_402|persuaded to change his mind.
p228_001|please call stella.
p228_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p228_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p228_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p228_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p228_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p228_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p228_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p228_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p228_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p228_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p228_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p228_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p228_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p228_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p228_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p228_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p228_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p228_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p228_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p228_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p228_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p228_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p228_025|it's nice to hear.
p228_026|so if we can take anything from tonight it will be fantastic.
p228_027|because we do not need it.
p228_028|there's a story too.
p228_029|i feel i did not have enough time.
p228_030|life was like a timetable.
p228_031|he took me on a tour of the wards.
p228_032|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p228_033|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p228_034|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p228_035|it was clear.
p228_036|the problem is the pitch.
p228_037|indeed he does.
p228_038|president bush is at war.
p228_039|she is believed to be in south africa.
p228_040|my whole life has changed.
p228_041|on this showing they should stick with the lads.
p228_042|no meaningful response was issued.
p228_043|it is urgent.
p228_044|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p228_045|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p228_046|we need to chat.
p228_047|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p228_048|the scottish parliament is also looking at similar measures.
p228_049|but it might have done.
p228_050|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p228_051|mary archer is almost too clever.
p228_052|he looks like an afghan.
p228_053|here's a clue.
p228_054|it had been in place since last july.
p228_055|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p228_056|that's the day job.
p228_057|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p228_058|that's the truth.
p228_059|that is very hard alone.
p228_060|he will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p228_061|four other charges were dropped.
p228_062|they're appalled by that.
p228_063|there was a battle there.
p228_064|scotland had great assets.
p228_065|it's that kind of place.
p228_066|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p228_067|an appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p228_068|and if he hadn't become a musician ?
p228_069|he is a young man with a new deal.
p228_070|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p228_071|the script was funny.
p228_072|try to save us.
p228_073|sounds like the sixth sense ?
p228_074|painful but only because it's true.
p228_075|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p228_076|it's all i can do.
p228_077|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p228_078|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p228_079|i had my suspicions.
p228_081|people must remain vigilant.
p228_082|today she has been released.
p228_083|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p228_084|he liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p228_085|but she might be.
p228_086|nothing is yet confirmed.
p228_087|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p228_088|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p228_089|every time i play i do not understand their reaction.
p228_090|now the system is right behind us.
p228_091|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p228_092|today i couldn't run on it.
p228_093|however it did not end that way.
p228_094|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p228_095|safety was also an issue.
p228_096|it is an old family habit.
p228_097|i have every confidence in raymond robertson as chairman of the party.
p228_098|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p228_099|it is annoying.
p228_100|we could not get any possession.
p228_101|i love the dome.
p228_102|we have always maintained that we would never abandon scottish football.
p228_103|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p228_104|he is hungry for success and i am the same.
p228_105|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p228_106|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p228_107|it is a good day for the coalition.
p228_108|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p228_109|however the intensive care unit at the southern general hospital was full.
p228_110|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p228_111|meanwhile the scottish consumer council yesterday offered support for the new bill.
p228_112|we have an election in eight days.
p228_113|for these people the ruling is very welcome.
p228_114|they will want to perform well.
p228_115|the eye was badly closed on sunday.
p228_116|however they will only be found in the wild.
p228_117|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p228_118|further protests are likely.
p228_119|it's in his blood.
p228_120|i don't want to use the term.
p228_121|the picture is the same across scotland.
p228_122|naturally it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p228_123|it is so sad.
p228_124|it's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p228_125|until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p228_126|who would be a referee ?
p228_127|they've got to account for it.
p228_128|it is a delight on every level.
p228_129|an announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p228_130|here again they were denied a voice.
p228_131|i felt very strongly that england should have it.
p228_132|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p228_133|this plan is an agenda for action.
p228_134|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p228_135|buckingham palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p228_136|offered the gold medal he declined.
p228_137|who will attend ?
p228_138|we had a reunion last week.
p228_139|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p228_140|we are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p228_141|i was the last man to touch the ball.
p228_142|he was in a great deal of pain.
p228_143|nobody in the world can get away from him.
p228_144|she hopes to study in britain one day.
p228_145|wallace was a prisoner of war.
p228_146|i think he's the favourite no question.
p228_147|who would be right ?
p228_148|it is difficult for ali.
p228_149|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p228_150|had she enjoyed the experience ?
p228_151|that should do it.
p228_152|that could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p228_153|it is not just about pay.
p228_154|i am just trying to do my job.
p228_155|it opens the door to the champions league.
p228_156|the home side didn't stand a chance.
p228_157|the amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p228_158|the weather forecast isn't good.
p228_159|the departure of mr johnston was reported by the herald yesterday.
p228_160|there's a sense of excess in the novel.
p228_161|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p228_162|it was by the numbers.
p228_163|i was in daily contact.
p228_164|the weather affected the other two games in fife.
p228_165|alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p228_166|it was so new so exciting.
p228_167|but we have not heard a thing from diego.
p228_168|i've put my own money into this project.
p228_169|eight months later he was dead.
p228_170|they say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p228_171|we have to move forward.
p228_172|by then however both men were already in the us.
p228_173|we have to sort it out ourselves.
p228_174|the post will be unpaid.
p228_175|as far as we were concerned the deal with kennedy was dead.
p228_176|and i was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p228_177|we've made a couple of albums.
p228_178|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p228_179|mr blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p228_180|one season they might do well.
p228_181|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p228_182|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p228_183|the hotel was now for sale.
p228_184|i drove the ball well.
p228_185|i took the gun.
p228_186|we knew nothing about it.
p228_187|they will run a mile.
p228_188|it's a portrait of glasgow not the portrait.
p228_189|mr marshall is expected to join the council of europe.
p228_190|miller was every bit as happy.
p228_191|i put the drawing down.
p228_192|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p228_193|it was an odd affair in many respects.
p228_194|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p228_195|we talk about mr michael johnson and he is awesome.
p228_196|we are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p228_197|the procedure is the same in all cases.
p228_198|but a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p228_199|the appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p228_200|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p228_202|it's the same old story.
p228_203|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p228_204|is that success ?
p228_205|i have a cold.
p228_206|they are in the euro.
p228_207|ferguson should take note.
p228_208|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p228_209|who will pay for this ?
p228_210|they've got three quarters of the way.
p228_211|he had suffered a heart attack.
p228_212|a deadline is still essential.
p228_213|yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
p228_214|we will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p228_215|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p228_216|that will be vital.
p228_217|even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p228_218|that is an important part of our role.
p228_219|she should not be blamed.
p228_220|i had decided to quit the show.
p228_221|his third goal was superb.
p228_222|it's been a good year.
p228_223|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p228_224|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p228_225|women were mostly notable by their absence.
p228_226|the loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p228_227|clearly the stakes are high.
p228_228|it is a gamble.
p228_229|it's so special.
p228_230|you take a risk.
p228_231|he is severe.
p228_232|we just had a go.
p228_233|we are in the hat.
p228_234|we were a load of rubbish.
p228_235|well they were the unlucky ones.
p228_236|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p228_237|the perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p228_238|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p228_239|he claimed the government had lost the plot.
p228_240|she was well balanced.
p228_241|it's only fair.
p228_242|he says that he is no different from any other man.
p228_243|you can feel at home in china.
p228_244|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p228_245|it is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p228_246|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p228_247|he's a lovely young man.
p228_248|it was a hit.
p228_249|he said he was impressed by the set up at celtic.
p228_250|i can't get a job.
p228_251|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p228_252|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p228_253|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p228_254|certainly in terms of league position we must be favourites.
p228_255|that's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p228_256|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p228_257|is that a serious question ?
p228_258|they are real.
p228_259|they must play for each other.
p228_260|i have never been a close friend of jim mclean.
p228_261|his contract was then not renewed.
p228_262|he thought he had a month to cross the street.
p228_263|labour's scottish general secretary alex rowley was delighted yesterday.
p228_264|that decision is for the british parliament and people.
p228_265|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p228_266|our dispute is with the company not the travelling public.
p228_267|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p228_268|i was rubbish.
p228_269|he's been here on numerous occasions.
p228_270|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p228_271|it's a way of life.
p228_272|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p228_274|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p228_275|they were too hard.
p228_276|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p228_277|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p228_278|all options are open.
p228_279|he will address the nation this evening.
p228_280|we want to see the maximum of change.
p228_281|mr campbell received a phone call.
p228_282|he was obviously very genuine.
p228_283|she said she could not believe that they had run away.
p228_284|it changed my life.
p228_285|the songs are just so good.
p228_286|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p228_287|right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p228_288|it became a book by itself.
p228_289|the home was now under new management.
p228_290|graeme was prepared.
p228_291|within months he was a part time tribunal chairman.
p228_292|he was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p228_293|our task is to complete the picture.
p228_294|they are wrong.
p228_295|it is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p228_296|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p228_297|you are the glory.
p228_298|it's certainly different.
p228_299|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p228_300|we want to play at the worlds.
p228_301|we have waited a long time for this.
p228_302|is there on his hands ?
p228_303|this wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p228_304|it's not even finished.
p228_305|we are a peaceful people.
p228_306|kids are terrible.
p228_307|the problems began a long time ago.
p228_308|this film will be totally awesome.
p228_309|he said she was mad.
p228_310|there was some merit in that.
p228_311|i am very happy to be here.
p228_312|we do the same.
p228_313|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p228_315|it's not long enough.
p228_316|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p228_317|it was no secret that i wanted to sign him.
p228_318|he was then replaced by ross.
p228_319|is that an issue ?
p228_320|my first concern is for the safety of the public.
p228_321|robert is a special talent.
p228_322|a few days after making the video i went to the inquiry.
p228_323|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p228_324|there was no option.
p228_325|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p228_326|it is a sign of hope.
p228_327|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p228_328|it has moved on in the last week.
p228_329|the train was on time.
p228_330|it is so unfair.
p228_331|he has to learn.
p228_332|but the disease has not been confined to the tory party.
p228_333|i've got no secret.
p228_334|tiger is the exception.
p228_335|a great deal has been achieved.
p228_336|it was forced to divert.
p228_337|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p228_338|this is a friendly match ?
p228_339|i was pleased to be back on the podium in brazil.
p228_340|he's a genius.
p228_341|they should take their mobile phones.
p228_342|it is not like working for a living.
p228_343|it's the last thing on my mind.
p228_344|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p228_345|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p228_346|that is a break with tradition.
p228_347|she is free.
p228_348|everyone was in tears.
p228_349|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p228_350|as indeed they would be.
p228_351|no other job in world football can compare to this one.
p228_352|i expected these kind of questions.
p228_353|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p228_354|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p228_355|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p228_356|equity declined to comment.
p228_357|he later became a respected high court judge.
p228_358|the play is based on a real life event.
p228_359|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p228_360|the final decision was between scotland and the republic of ireland.
p228_361|he put some colour into scottish history.
p228_362|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p228_363|i decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p228_364|it is a simple equation.
p228_365|so there we won.
p228_366|but i managed.
p228_367|by that time however it was already too late.
p228_368|i am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p228_369|there is no signature.
p228_370|it's a record label not a form of music.
p228_371|it became a national network.
p229_001|please call stella.
p229_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p229_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p229_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p229_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p229_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p229_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p229_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p229_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p229_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p229_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p229_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p229_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p229_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p229_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p229_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p229_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p229_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p229_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p229_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p229_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p229_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p229_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p229_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p229_025|johnson was pretty low.
p229_026|he said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p229_027|it's nice to hear.
p229_028|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p229_029|i have a theory.
p229_030|it's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p229_031|so if we can take anything from tonight it will be fantastic.
p229_032|because we do not need it.
p229_033|and we have a singer.
p229_034|a search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p229_035|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p229_036|i'd like to continue that record.
p229_037|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p229_038|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p229_039|they're just different.
p229_040|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p229_041|it is not for any other purpose.
p229_042|he did not know his daughter.
p229_043|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p229_044|i was scared.
p229_045|it will come all right.
p229_046|but it took a lot of bottle.
p229_047|but it is all by design.
p229_048|i am just going to go for it.
p229_050|we need to chat.
p229_051|it is difficult for ali.
p229_052|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p229_053|a recording contract is on the horizon.
p229_054|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p229_055|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p229_056|we've got a lot of respect for the lions.
p229_057|she's a spy
p229_058|what was the main difference ?
p229_059|my mother is a widow.
p229_060|and a film maker was born.
p229_061|art is extra.
p229_062|scotland had great assets.
p229_063|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p229_064|we should have known.
p229_065|it is like a river running by my home.
p229_066|try to save us.
p229_067|that was the easy election.
p229_068|i was as strong as a horse.
p229_069|ferguson should take note.
p229_070|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p229_071|neither it is.
p229_072|she died in hospital two hours later.
p229_073|it was chaotic.
p229_074|it is a job creation scheme.
p229_075|it works for us.
p229_076|i've not thought about it.
p229_077|two israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p229_078|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p229_079|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p229_080|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p229_081|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p229_082|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p229_083|someone who cares
p229_084|he can do everything.
p229_085|by then he was walking on water.
p229_086|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p229_087|others were in hiding in fear of their lives.
p229_088|they lived for their children.
p229_089|it is a lifeline.
p229_090|however it did not end that way.
p229_091|we must look forward.
p229_092|it is an old family habit.
p229_093|well the big day has arrived.
p229_094|i have every confidence in raymond robertson as chairman of the party.
p229_095|until you hit the big games.
p229_096|the main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p229_097|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p229_098|she's got to say something.
p229_099|he is hungry for success and i am the same.
p229_100|they were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p229_101|she has so much to offer.
p229_102|the court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p229_103|it is a good day for the coalition.
p229_104|we work on the same level.
p229_105|they were outside the circle.
p229_106|two of the team became ill.
p229_108|i didn't play well last year.
p229_109|before the game we went for a pint.
p229_110|i'm not depressed.
p229_111|it is normal.
p229_112|he plans to call for an aid package from mr macdonald.
p229_113|i don't have many friends.
p229_114|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p229_115|i came to complete.
p229_116|i was angry.
p229_117|they were behind the wheel.
p229_118|the fire was above the hole.
p229_119|it's not fair.
p229_120|we are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p229_121|on this showing they should stick with the lads.
p229_122|maybe this battle has been.
p229_123|i'm delighted about that.
p229_124|i joined a group.
p229_125|it is rubbish.
p229_126|who would be a referee ?
p229_127|it was my own fault and i lost a lot of belief.
p229_128|the whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p229_129|an announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p229_130|here again they were denied a voice.
p229_131|there will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p229_132|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p229_133|she really suffered for her art.
p229_134|next season for every manager is a long time away.
p229_135|it's an amazing landscape
p229_136|so the european elections are extremely important.
p229_137|he is slightly confused.
p229_138|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p229_139|if not a deal could take many months.
p229_140|they took a risk.
p229_141|government will intervene.
p229_142|what will happen then ?
p229_143|we never said that we would walk through the third division.
p229_144|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p229_145|this represents a tough game for us.
p229_146|i was the last man to touch the ball.
p229_147|nobody in the world can get away from him.
p229_148|three penalties were given.
p229_149|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p229_150|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p229_151|who would be right ?
p229_152|we just had a go.
p229_153|he felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p229_154|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p229_155|he sets the nature of his parliament in a simple realistic context.
p229_156|initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p229_157|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p229_158|the home side didn't stand a chance.
p229_159|crucially though united were still alive.
p229_160|charles gordon leader of glasgow city council declined to comment.
p229_161|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p229_162|it's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p229_163|it was by the numbers.
p229_164|i knew he was good.
p229_165|he then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p229_166|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p229_167|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p229_168|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p229_169|was this element always there ?
p229_170|alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p229_171|a new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p229_172|i will tell you.
p229_173|a labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p229_174|it could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p229_175|military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p229_176|we have to move forward.
p229_177|it's that sort of night.
p229_178|customers for the panels include the national trust for scotland.
p229_179|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p229_180|the post will be unpaid.
p229_181|does that put pressure on us ?
p229_182|it is a memorial.
p229_183|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p229_184|they thought they had found a home.
p229_185|one season they might do well.
p229_186|is saddam a threat ?
p229_187|the home was now under new management.
p229_188|he asked me in a tolerance zone.
p229_189|the hotel was now for sale.
p229_190|i drove the ball well.
p229_191|it is the whole package.
p229_192|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p229_193|we knew nothing about it.
p229_194|it is minute.
p229_195|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p229_196|four policemen were wounded.
p229_197|what has caused the demise of singing ?
p229_198|any change would be subject to the scottish parliament's approval.
p229_199|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p229_200|i've got good news and bad news for you.
p229_201|we are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p229_202|people will ask about us.
p229_203|the work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p229_204|last night was a key episode.
p229_205|mr kennedy is not a candidate for the scottish parliament.
p229_206|it wasn't to be.
p229_207|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p229_209|i came home by ambulance.
p229_210|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p229_211|it's the same old story.
p229_212|but we are not immune to the problem.
p229_213|he has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p229_214|the sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p229_215|the procedures were not in place.
p229_216|it was worth a photograph.
p229_217|we will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p229_218|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p229_219|saddam hussein is a devil.
p229_220|that is an important part of our role.
p229_221|she should not be blamed.
p229_222|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p229_223|i am delighted for simon.
p229_224|i had decided to quit the show.
p229_225|the fbi could become involved.
p229_226|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p229_227|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p229_228|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p229_229|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p229_230|who was on the panel ?
p229_231|we've got the bronze.
p229_232|saturday is gone.
p229_233|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p229_234|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p229_235|the boy is no longer with us.
p229_236|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p229_237|the track is currently covered in snow.
p229_238|i am very sorry that alastair campbell has taken this decision.
p229_239|you should always be able to get out in some direction.
p229_240|we are so proud.
p229_241|we were a load of rubbish.
p229_242|the singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p229_243|it's an idea.
p229_244|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p229_245|the sanctions are about collective punishment.
p229_246|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p229_247|the perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p229_248|the problem in norway is outside the national.
p229_249|the letters are going out today.
p229_250|it's only fair.
p229_251|chambers said he would accept the place.
p229_252|manager bobby williamson has no injury worries.
p229_253|it is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p229_254|it was a hit.
p229_255|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p229_256|this year i understood.
p229_257|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p229_258|kirkwood was arrested.
p229_259|this is a big club.
p229_260|that's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p229_261|i was happily surprised.
p229_262|they must play for each other.
p229_263|the pensioners did not want to know.
p229_264|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p229_265|today we can say that a new era has begun.
p229_266|that is highly unfair.
p229_267|the warning is timely.
p229_268|their findings are published in the journal injury prevention.
p229_269|that decision is for the british parliament and people.
p229_270|they are never here.
p229_271|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p229_272|he was also married with two children.
p229_273|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p229_274|we're in shock.
p229_275|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p229_277|it's a way of life.
p229_278|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p229_279|he promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p229_280|i am an estate agent.
p229_281|people have no choice.
p229_282|they were on holiday in egypt.
p229_283|it was a privilege to work for him.
p229_284|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p229_285|if not he should go home.
p229_286|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p229_287|i saw it at a ruck.
p229_288|i felt like i was a child.
p229_289|what would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
p229_290|the orchestra is quite good but the hall is terrible.
p229_292|we have other options.
p229_293|i do not think this family will ever get over this.
p229_294|it shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p229_295|these figures are truly awful.
p229_296|sunday's game was not a trial.
p229_297|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p229_298|the move was welcomed by the roman catholic church in scotland.
p229_300|i was brought up in a mining background.
p229_301|i thought it was my only chance.
p229_302|within months he was a part time tribunal chairman.
p229_303|the award to senator mitchell was announced by the foreign office.
p229_304|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p229_305|there is no openness.
p229_306|this is a war over our home.
p229_307|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p229_308|it's just not funny
p229_309|it is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p229_310|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p229_311|you are the glory.
p229_312|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p229_313|let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p229_314|it's certainly different.
p229_315|o neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p229_316|this is the culture change in medicine.
p229_318|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p229_319|there is no other solution to congestion in edinburgh.
p229_320|it's not even finished.
p229_322|it should be equal.
p229_323|cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the balkans.
p229_324|we are very strongly behind the bid.
p229_325|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p229_326|i am very happy to be here.
p229_328|it was no secret that i wanted to sign him.
p229_329|on thursday mr blair will address the institute of public policy research.
p229_330|it could have gone either way.
p229_331|he was then replaced by ross.
p229_332|i'd like to take the plunge.
p229_333|she did not attend the courtroom.
p229_334|it is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p229_335|he told the court.
p229_336|the team for the first game could be this one.
p229_337|they haven't got a hope.
p229_338|it has moved on in the last week.
p229_339|gaelic provision continued to be good.
p229_340|he did a good job.
p229_341|i'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p229_342|today she has been released.
p229_343|these days are long gone.
p229_344|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p229_345|but the disease has not been confined to the tory party.
p229_346|indeed it was magical.
p229_347|i've got no secret.
p229_348|look at the witnesses.
p229_349|the visual arts committee took this decision in december.
p229_350|i'm very lucky.
p229_351|they may yet have the last laugh.
p229_352|everything was an effort.
p229_353|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p229_354|like his acting it was an accident.
p229_355|it is long gone.
p229_356|it's the last thing on my mind.
p229_357|tell us about it.
p229_358|there is a cup final at stake.
p229_359|that is a break with tradition.
p229_360|it was very formal.
p229_361|they say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p229_362|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p229_363|it benefits the whole family.
p229_364|it was fit for royalty.
p229_365|we are looking for perfection.
p229_366|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p229_367|the group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p229_368|i am a star.
p229_369|we do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p229_370|he could make it.
p229_371|he later became a respected high court judge.
p229_373|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p229_374|it is not too late to get on board.
p229_376|it is a simple equation.
p229_377|talks are progressing.
p229_378|they play together perfectly.
p229_379|it's a long process.
p229_380|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p229_381|it does not even have a staff shortage.
p229_382|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p229_384|it is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p229_386|three years ago he would have been.
p229_387|that team is due to be announced this morning.
p229_388|it has been a lovely family occasion.
p229_389|that's the name of the game though.
p229_390|there were no casualties.
p229_391|a council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p229_392|yet the data is compelling.
p230_001|please call stella.
p230_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p230_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p230_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p230_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p230_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p230_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p230_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p230_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p230_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p230_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p230_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p230_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p230_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p230_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p230_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p230_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p230_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p230_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p230_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p230_025|it is on the internet.
p230_026|smoking is also very important.
p230_027|he has the courage of the unaware.
p230_028|life was like a timetable.
p230_029|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p230_030|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p230_031|i'm so happy that she did.
p230_032|the wedding was in edinburgh.
p230_033|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p230_034|he really is a lovely man.
p230_035|the staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p230_036|this represents a tough game for us.
p230_037|the boy is no longer with us.
p230_038|they said she was stable.
p230_039|this will save interest charges.
p230_040|well he is an artist.
p230_041|he looks like an afghan.
p230_042|people want to see me on the screen.
p230_043|the big problem is the lack of grass.
p230_044|that was the theory anyway.
p230_045|i was inspired by two things.
p230_046|if not he should go home.
p230_047|i must take a seat.
p230_048|it was bound to happen.
p230_049|we have to bring in new players.
p230_050|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p230_051|i have made that offer.
p230_052|none has ever been found.
p230_053|four other charges were dropped.
p230_054|we should be able to cope.
p230_055|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p230_056|we will pay their bills.
p230_057|you should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p230_058|it was exactly four months away.
p230_059|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p230_060|it's not covered by the insurance.
p230_061|but the challenge is in the us.
p230_062|robin williams is very subdued.
p230_063|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p230_064|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p230_065|both sides have been hit by injury.
p230_066|he also received a medal of honour.
p230_068|it may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p230_069|it is a job creation scheme.
p230_070|it looks like a hit.
p230_071|what do we do ?
p230_072|why do it otherwise ?
p230_073|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p230_074|however he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p230_075|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p230_076|consumer confidence remains an issue.
p230_077|last week he was taken into hospital.
p230_078|this is a true story.
p230_079|by then he was walking on water.
p230_080|it's so hard to shift.
p230_081|they lived for their children.
p230_083|it might change your life.
p230_084|you are a great player.
p230_085|however it did not end that way.
p230_086|we will deal with the refugees.
p230_087|it was not an insult.
p230_088|you might not make it.
p230_089|however a decision should be made before the end of august.
p230_090|i did not have a bet on myself.
p230_091|the conclusion is the same.
p230_092|he was prepared for this.
p230_093|but i know the course.
p230_094|you are like an animal.
p230_095|we intend to change the model.
p230_096|it was some time before she found out he was safe.
p230_097|two of the team became ill.
p230_099|it has been a nightmare of frustration.
p230_100|but his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p230_101|before the game we went for a pint.
p230_102|this was a good move for me.
p230_103|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p230_104|i was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p230_105|it is close to call.
p230_106|it is an impressive record.
p230_107|it is a total and utter change of culture.
p230_108|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p230_109|abbey national is an option.
p230_110|the arrival of the scottish premier league has also presented a problem.
p230_112|we have the mental strength.
p230_113|you can spend money on housing.
p230_114|that admission is not surprising.
p230_115|i can't even get into the a team.
p230_116|lady thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p230_117|which can happen any time.
p230_118|it is too pretty it is too small.
p230_119|but this time we can have no excuses.
p230_120|they are very happy with the new settlement.
p230_121|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p230_122|something will be done by corporate bodies.
p230_123|we did what we had to do.
p230_124|she was also very brave.
p230_125|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p230_126|we must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p230_127|the opposite is the case.
p230_128|he was a home referee.
p230_129|this is a successful outcome.
p230_130|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p230_131|she died at her home.
p230_132|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p230_133|five minutes later the home team were back in front.
p230_134|it was a piece of art.
p230_135|i would relish the prospect.
p230_137|these men are a part of india.
p230_138|i was caught out a little bit.
p230_139|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p230_140|i have wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p230_141|it has to be an event.
p230_142|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p230_143|crucially though united were still alive.
p230_144|the first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
p230_145|she has gone to the catholic school.
p230_146|it was by the numbers.
p230_147|i am not going to make any further comment apart from that.
p230_148|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p230_149|however he was later released without charge.
p230_150|this might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p230_151|these days are long gone.
p230_152|i'm afraid to say anything.
p230_153|we are still getting over it.
p230_154|it has to be now.
p230_155|it could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p230_156|you have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p230_157|they will do their own thing.
p230_158|you had to go and see him.
p230_159|so what is the campaign about ?
p230_160|and does it ?
p230_161|are you from the rugby ?
p230_162|had i heard ?
p230_163|next year it plans to open an office in tokyo.
p230_164|our position remains the same.
p230_165|nobody did in those days.
p230_166|we believe in the medium term.
p230_167|it's nice to be nice.
p230_168|to get good people you need to offer them enough money.
p230_169|on the month the weakness was across the board.
p230_170|one season they might do well.
p230_171|manchester united can win the european cup this season.
p230_172|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p230_173|but he has a lifeline.
p230_174|phase one was a shambles.
p230_175|city sentiment is in his favour.
p230_176|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p230_177|at the top level the salaries are far too high.
p230_178|tomorrow is a new day.
p230_179|it makes no influence on the public.
p230_180|she has left the island.
p230_181|he played it like a veteran.
p230_182|i have spoken to head office.
p230_183|they will run a mile.
p230_184|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p230_185|our destiny is in our own hands.
p230_186|he prefers to play for them.
p230_188|he lives in a neighbouring village.
p230_189|it was an odd affair in many respects.
p230_190|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p230_191|we represent a wide range of society.
p230_192|we always felt we could win.
p230_194|this year it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p230_195|it is not all good news and relief for labour however.
p230_196|neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p230_198|i made a terrible start.
p230_199|the result is called a patent.
p230_200|we played them off the pitch.
p230_201|racism has no place in any sport.
p230_202|tommy is not a problem.
p230_203|the sanctions are about collective punishment.
p230_204|this is a holy place.
p230_205|he had suffered a heart attack.
p230_206|the tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p230_207|we see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p230_208|this will take several weeks.
p230_209|the research is published in the journal nature.
p230_210|we have an election in eight days.
p230_211|flanker gordon simpson may also feature in that match.
p230_212|there is no quick fix.
p230_213|all will be revealed in due course.
p230_214|we used to live with dignity in our country.
p230_215|the most exciting room is the final one of the show.
p230_216|he has made his base in spain.
p230_217|my life is in the ballet.
p230_218|basically they have to come up with the offer.
p230_219|it's all change at kilmarnock.
p230_220|his second was a beauty.
p230_221|what do we want to do that for ?
p230_222|does the name matter ?
p230_223|how do you get it back ?
p230_224|what are you not good at ?
p230_225|the prime minister was informed on thursday.
p230_226|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p230_227|it was a day for records.
p230_228|he remains a main board director of royal.
p230_230|that has been the easy part.
p230_231|things were so intense in the studio.
p230_232|i was not sure whether i had won.
p230_233|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p230_234|so far the problems have occurred in the us.
p230_235|it is the voice of the survivors.
p230_236|it had so much to do with output.
p230_237|must have been at the bar.
p230_238|she died in middle age.
p230_239|no evidence that it was osama bin laden.
p230_240|they need to win a trophy.
p230_241|half the young people had had contact with the police.
p230_242|it is possible to be too good.
p230_243|in many ways that is as important.
p230_244|here is a question for you.
p230_245|i was just a kid.
p230_246|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p230_247|hospitals are for the ill.
p230_248|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p230_249|employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p230_250|we have to compete at our own level.
p230_251|they showed a lot of heart.
p230_252|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p230_253|it might be sad but it's a fact.
p230_254|she took them for a term.
p230_255|kingfisher can afford to wait.
p230_257|nato was not a love affair.
p230_258|defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p230_259|manager bobby williamson has no injury worries.
p230_260|in fact we were all over the shop.
p230_261|you can feel at home in china.
p230_262|persuaded to change his mind.
p230_263|either way the investor retains the premium.
p230_264|it is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p230_265|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p230_266|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p230_267|i should think so too.
p230_268|scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p230_269|i've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
p230_270|i was ready for this.
p230_271|on the contrary they stand to gain.
p230_272|they are interior designers and architects.
p230_273|that should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p230_274|we feel very good about it.
p230_276|it succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p230_277|it is also very valuable.
p230_278|none of this work is guaranteed.
p230_279|there is a case to answer.
p230_280|we're trying to get rounded performers.
p230_281|they can leave at any time.
p230_282|and they were being paid ?
p230_283|was everything done to save people ?
p230_284|what was the matter for concern ?
p230_285|do i think about them often ?
p230_286|that was a gold medal for certain.
p230_287|you get a lot for your money.
p230_288|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p230_289|in that moment i was happy.
p230_290|the actor has met with mandela.
p230_291|it was never a free kick.
p230_292|it is a recipe for success.
p230_293|i would rather look at him.
p230_295|it's got to come from me.
p230_296|it took a month and a half to film.
p230_297|the cause of the accident remained unclear.
p230_298|it is a symbolic concert.
p230_299|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p230_300|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p230_302|he is at war with his knee.
p230_303|again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p230_304|i was there five months ago.
p230_305|you have to see it like this.
p230_306|rugby is now just like football.
p230_307|it could well be military.
p230_308|his job was not advertised.
p230_309|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p230_310|we have a clean bill of health.
p230_311|and we can do it.
p230_312|the songs are just so good.
p230_313|the casting is as perfect.
p230_314|i can hardly believe it.
p230_315|i must do something about it.
p230_316|our message to the monetary policy committee is clear.
p230_317|if you can run a computer you can talk to the world.
p230_318|they are not left wing.
p230_319|mcnaughton was not so sure.
p230_321|it is a road of death.
p230_322|the party lasted all night.
p230_323|the group is not paying a dividend.
p230_324|we were on our way.
p230_325|i was as strong as a horse.
p230_326|that meant the search was unlawful.
p230_327|we have a good healthy debate.
p230_328|i would do away with the dress code.
p230_329|we are on a four year mission.
p230_330|this is a historic occasion.
p230_331|this ruling is a farce.
p230_332|i can see their argument.
p230_333|after some discussion they did.
p230_334|it was always an option.
p230_335|does that put pressure on us ?
p230_336|did it work ?
p230_337|do you think we are a top nation ?
p230_338|public opinion was split on the proposal.
p230_339|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p230_340|you may have a short memory.
p230_341|clearly the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p230_342|in the old days it was easy.
p230_343|there was some merit in that.
p230_344|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p230_345|the airport was even different.
p230_346|clark was desperate to return to the house of commons.
p230_347|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p230_348|there was no time scale.
p230_349|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p230_350|on thursday mr blair will address the institute of public policy research.
p230_351|he is not very big either.
p230_352|i have a moral dilemma.
p230_353|even the one she loved.
p230_354|you have no chance of planning permission.
p230_355|we are encouraged by the news.
p230_356|in addition certain areas closed at certain times.
p230_357|the professor said the results were positive.
p230_358|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p230_359|three years ago he would have been.
p230_360|not that scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p230_361|the announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p230_362|i am a lucky man.
p230_363|nobody else was with me.
p230_364|we put our bid in last night.
p230_365|alex ferguson is the same.
p230_366|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p230_367|but ba said the prediction was premature.
p230_368|like his acting it was an accident.
p230_369|they have broken the promise.
p230_370|we are really good friends.
p230_371|my goal is quite simple.
p230_372|this is a major championship.
p230_373|it's going to be fun.
p230_374|she is now on the back benches.
p230_375|scrutiny by european parliament is limited.
p230_376|this hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p230_377|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p230_378|we are a scottish company.
p230_379|we will win the argument.
p230_380|tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p230_381|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p230_382|i always knew she was funny.
p230_383|he is a close friend of gordon brown.
p230_384|the marshall at the turn was great.
p230_385|if you can get it.
p230_386|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p230_387|there was a substantial explosion.
p230_388|the government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p230_389|he could face a jail sentence.
p230_390|that is the consistent approach of the government.
p230_391|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p230_392|clark is back on top form.
p230_393|motion described it as a unique event.
p230_394|i had a fortunate war.
p230_395|are they free ?
p230_396|what are they for ?
p230_397|is there a waiting list ?
p230_398|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p230_399|that investment has now been secured.
p230_400|it is a large number.
p230_401|you will not feel a thing.
p230_402|i've never seen a game like it.
p230_404|it does not even have a staff shortage.
p230_405|it was a bank holiday after all.
p230_406|we're obviously disturbed by this case.
p230_407|the casualties were not named.
p230_408|it is a temptation which should be resisted.
p230_409|it had been on the cards.
p230_410|the second goal was superb.
p230_411|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p230_413|even if they come out playing a physical game we can cope.
p230_414|it is the old story.
p230_415|this should put downward pressure on inflation.
p230_416|no date has been set for a meeting.
p230_417|we have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
p231_001|please call stella.
p231_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p231_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p231_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p231_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p231_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p231_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p231_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p231_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p231_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p231_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p231_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p231_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p231_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p231_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p231_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p231_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p231_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p231_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p231_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p231_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p231_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p231_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p231_025|on our numbers the price is in line with the asset value.
p231_026|i'd just like to play.
p231_027|because we do not need it.
p231_028|there was a rush of water.
p231_029|last night mr robertson said he was delighted.
p231_030|that deal is a joke.
p231_031|the premier league has been a huge success.
p231_032|if we cannot succeed in this endeavour then so be it.
p231_033|it carried a double message.
p231_034|that means an extra two years.
p231_035|i became a widow overnight.
p231_036|but he can turn on the charm.
p231_037|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p231_038|the man became a reporter.
p231_039|mr blair last night attended his weekly audience with the queen.
p231_040|last year i was pretty bad.
p231_041|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p231_042|among them are many criminals.
p231_043|he looks like an afghan.
p231_044|he declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p231_045|i guess i was lucky though.
p231_046|i was inspired by two things.
p231_047|a win is a win.
p231_048|there was no safety net.
p231_049|there's nothing we could do about this.
p231_050|it is a symbolic concert.
p231_051|we keep an eye on it.
p231_052|we have not given up hope.
p231_053|the cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p231_054|she said she was really sorry.
p231_055|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p231_056|italy is a beautiful place.
p231_057|four other charges were dropped.
p231_058|we should be able to cope.
p231_059|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p231_061|so is that it then ?
p231_062|do i have a favourite ?
p231_063|what do we do ?
p231_064|it was a lovely experience.
p231_065|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p231_066|we will pay their bills.
p231_067|only water is currently allowed.
p231_068|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p231_069|we need to increase the membership.
p231_070|this is an exciting new venture.
p231_071|he highlighted a lack of staff.
p231_072|then followed a bout of flu.
p231_073|both sides have been hit by injury.
p231_074|both men were on one year contracts.
p231_076|that would be too easy.
p231_078|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p231_079|both agreed on the success of the event.
p231_080|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p231_081|on saturday it was much the same.
p231_082|it's so hard to shift.
p231_083|they lived for their children.
p231_085|however it did not end that way.
p231_086|strathclyde police declined to comment.
p231_087|it is an old family habit.
p231_088|he's been hit by it.
p231_089|however a decision should be made before the end of august.
p231_090|i saw the whole thing.
p231_091|but i know the course.
p231_092|their attitude is all wrong.
p231_093|we must stop it with the golf ball.
p231_094|you are like an animal.
p231_095|this is the logic of punishment assaults.
p231_097|we should recognise others have done a good job.
p231_098|we live by the rule of law.
p231_099|two of the team became ill.
p231_100|no the equipment is extra.
p231_101|that time is not now however.
p231_102|it's not a quick fix.
p231_103|why do it otherwise ?
p231_104|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p231_105|so did she meet him ?
p231_106|so what is the campaign about ?
p231_107|and does it ?
p231_108|before the game we went for a pint.
p231_109|we needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p231_110|you'd better believe it.
p231_111|new year will be very busy.
p231_112|there's still plenty time left.
p231_113|it proved a good decision.
p231_114|maybe this battle has been.
p231_115|january is a bad time of year.
p231_116|i was deeply saddened by the death of donald dewar.
p231_117|it is much as it has been described.
p231_118|then again we could have.
p231_119|it is a delight on every level.
p231_120|there were no grounds for his action.
p231_121|i was just a child.
p231_122|we should not be surprised.
p231_123|it was not a finale he would want to remember.
p231_124|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p231_125|that period was a struggle.
p231_126|it is too pretty it is too small.
p231_127|this should begin in october.
p231_128|that is far too high.
p231_129|if not a deal could take many months.
p231_130|it plans to return to this field.
p231_131|they made such decisions in london.
p231_132|yesterday mr hague dismissed the poll.
p231_133|it is a common problem.
p231_134|you're a gambling man.
p231_135|we must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p231_136|he is a great addition to our team.
p231_137|this is a successful outcome.
p231_138|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p231_139|put yourself in the position of being a referee.
p231_140|i think he's the favourite no question.
p231_141|i miss the freedom that i had.
p231_142|it only increased the support for him.
p231_143|anyone can do the sums.
p231_144|five minutes later the home team were back in front.
p231_145|it opens the door to the champions league.
p231_146|it has become a way of life.
p231_147|the whole industry is a shambles.
p231_148|there's only one team in ayrshire.
p231_149|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p231_150|we have a clean bill of health.
p231_151|it is not normal practice.
p231_152|the point is raised again that evening at the assembly rooms.
p231_153|he was asked to quit.
p231_154|a new school will be built.
p231_155|the strong pound also took its toll.
p231_156|it is a terrible tragedy.
p231_157|he was right into football from an early age.
p231_158|it is not like us.
p231_159|what happened in that game ?
p231_160|are you going to win ?
p231_161|was it the wife ?
p231_162|why change it ?
p231_163|what do we want to do that for ?
p231_164|he was in great spirits.
p231_165|we have a budget in march.
p231_166|you've been a great audience.
p231_167|it is simply not true.
p231_168|well this article is a bit like that.
p231_169|it is really good news.
p231_170|we've made a couple of albums.
p231_171|to get good people you need to offer them enough money.
p231_172|my life has been destroyed.
p231_173|i always felt they played for me.
p231_174|one season they might do well.
p231_175|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p231_176|this much i can tell you.
p231_177|the hibs manager is no fool.
p231_178|we are the gateway to justice.
p231_179|but one was not enough.
p231_180|i have spoken to head office.
p231_181|i am not ready to walk away.
p231_183|the shooting created panic in the street.
p231_184|so many people will be affected by this.
p231_185|as many as the market will support.
p231_186|they need to look after themselves.
p231_188|this is the time to use it.
p231_189|you know the sort of thing.
p231_190|i'm interested in interesting work.
p231_191|we represent a wide range of society.
p231_192|people will ask about us.
p231_193|neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p231_194|this should put downward pressure on inflation.
p231_195|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p231_196|i came home by ambulance.
p231_197|i suggest a new plan.
p231_198|it was a moment of madness.
p231_199|indeed he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p231_200|libya is an easy target.
p231_201|does the name matter ?
p231_202|how do you get it back ?
p231_203|what are you no good at ?
p231_205|who was she ?
p231_206|it gave no further details.
p231_207|you've caught a serial killer.
p231_208|i won't make an official complaint.
p231_209|we are a new department.
p231_210|it was worth a photograph.
p231_211|they are looking at flotation.
p231_212|which isn't a bad idea.
p231_213|we have an election in eight days.
p231_214|he also presented you bet
p231_215|that might help a bit.
p231_216|i had decided to quit the show.
p231_217|he has a lot of skill.
p231_218|i've wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p231_219|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p231_220|and the world cup has not even begun.
p231_221|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p231_222|that you can do it.
p231_223|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p231_224|they all made the european ryder cup team.
p231_225|crucially though united were still alive.
p231_226|this would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p231_228|we played them off the pitch.
p231_229|so far the problems have occurred in the us.
p231_230|they are the innocent victims.
p231_231|paterson can afford to be generous.
p231_232|she died in middle age.
p231_233|i'm so proud to be scottish tonight.
p231_234|it is set in paris.
p231_235|the irony was not lost.
p231_236|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p231_237|hospitals are for the ill.
p231_238|the minister is the engineer.
p231_239|my future is in the marathon.
p231_240|it is now the big brother.
p231_241|the parties have no contact.
p231_242|she took them for a term.
p231_243|nato was not a love affair.
p231_244|he is due in israel tomorrow.
p231_245|you can feel at home in china.
p231_246|his is a global perspective.
p231_247|persuaded to change his mind.
p231_248|either way the investor retains the premium.
p231_249|this ruling is a farce.
p231_250|the baby deserves the credit.
p231_251|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p231_252|but they were never expected to last.
p231_253|it was a cry for help.
p231_254|no production contract is yet in sight.
p231_255|tourism is a vital industry for scotland.
p231_256|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p231_257|he admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p231_258|it seems a shame to leave it.
p231_259|it was the climax of the thing.
p231_260|the concerns are the same.
p231_261|i can't get a job.
p231_262|and they were being paid ?
p231_263|was everything done to save people ?
p231_264|what was the matter for concern ?
p231_265|do i think about them often ?
p231_266|is it in the right place ?
p231_267|did he trip ?
p231_268|i've had the time of my life.
p231_269|the property is owned by glasgow city council.
p231_270|on the contrary they stand to gain.
p231_271|i thought he might have been a bit.
p231_272|this news came after the stock market closed on monday.
p231_273|i'd never run for them.
p231_274|it is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p231_275|it does not work that way in scottish football.
p231_276|these figures are truly terrible.
p231_277|share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
p231_278|the joint bid is still on course.
p231_279|at first i thought i was gone.
p231_280|the morale of the yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p231_281|they can leave at any time.
p231_282|that view has not altered.
p231_283|you get a lot for your money.
p231_284|blair also had a penalty.
p231_285|it would create a scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p231_286|frankly we should all have such problems.
p231_288|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p231_289|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p231_290|they were on holiday in egypt.
p231_291|it was not hard to feel some sympathy for baxter yesterday.
p231_292|i've lost all confidence.
p231_293|this could be a mistake.
p231_294|once again they would be wrong.
p231_295|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p231_296|it's all designed to speed up the service.
p231_297|he will address the nation this evening.
p231_298|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p231_299|i couldn't really work outside edinburgh.
p231_300|but it is up again.
p231_301|police were on the scene within minutes but the killer had fled.
p231_302|it could well be military.
p231_303|i was just so determined.
p231_304|that was the difference between the sides.
p231_305|the judge was really nice.
p231_307|you are a different people.
p231_308|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p231_309|he is still in shock.
p231_310|mcnaughton was not so sure.
p231_312|i thought it was my only chance.
p231_313|i thought he did very well.
p231_314|i'm not making any comment at all.
p231_315|employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p231_316|we're on our way.
p231_317|they come to enjoy themselves.
p231_318|that meant the search was unlawful.
p231_319|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p231_320|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p231_322|we want to play at the worlds.
p231_323|however walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p231_324|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p231_325|have a look at this lot.
p231_326|that decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p231_327|the king is delighted by the honour.
p231_328|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p231_329|the problems began a long time ago.
p231_330|i am not sure about the rate of progress.
p231_331|to beat the european champion is quite nice.
p231_332|in the old days it was easy.
p231_333|however the groups denied the claims.
p231_334|she is now on the back benches.
p231_336|i think it's about time.
p231_337|the airport was even different.
p231_338|there was no time scale.
p231_339|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p231_340|at first the youngster was not keen.
p231_341|the figures are bad but not that bad.
p231_342|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p231_343|shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p231_344|he was then replaced by ross.
p231_345|finally came the moment of truth.
p231_346|we are encouraged by the news.
p231_347|what form did that take ?
p231_348|are they free ?
p231_349|what are they for ?
p231_350|is there a waiting list ?
p231_351|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p231_352|so what happens next ?
p231_353|the units will not be replaced.
p231_354|neither man has been charged.
p231_355|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p231_357|look at the liberal democrats.
p231_358|i am a lucky man.
p231_359|but they have taken the lesson to heart.
p231_360|i've always been a sensitive.
p231_361|glasgow is a friendly city.
p231_362|you did not see it.
p231_363|we live on an island.
p231_364|it is not real life.
p231_365|neither woman has been named.
p231_366|they should take their mobile phones.
p231_367|you need a licence to run a pub.
p231_368|we regret that they're brought in the first place.
p231_369|lord macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p231_370|this is a major championship.
p231_371|the result is called a patent.
p231_372|but we finished the show.
p231_373|they were to blame for the first two goals.
p231_374|there is no deal as yet.
p231_375|here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p231_376|we were given a break.
p231_377|in due course the deal was done.
p231_378|to have products for their needs.
p231_379|the pair are very much in love.
p231_380|we will win the argument.
p231_381|had this been common practice ?
p231_382|what do they want us to do ?
p231_383|is it worth it ?
p231_384|does it matter ?
p231_385|you have to rely on each other.
p231_386|the internet is no substitute for customer service.
p231_387|i wanted to go out on a high.
p231_388|instead he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p231_389|that time may never be broken.
p231_390|it was fit for royalty.
p231_391|the response from them was good.
p231_392|there was a substantial explosion.
p231_393|but we are very near.
p231_394|that's as good as it gets.
p231_395|a review is under way.
p231_396|he put some colour into scottish history.
p231_397|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p231_398|they have failed to deliver.
p231_399|clark is back on top form.
p231_400|i had a fortunate war.
p231_401|she is in their hands.
p231_402|it is a large number.
p231_403|it does not even have a staff shortage.
p231_404|it is hard to understand.
p231_405|it was a bank holiday after all.
p231_406|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p231_407|there was an element of frustration.
p231_408|i should think so too.
p231_409|how do you take them away ?
p231_411|after the match do you ?
p231_412|i will always remember the horrible images.
p231_414|they are looking for profit.
p231_415|i remain a buyer of the shares.
p231_416|there is some light in the tunnel.
p231_417|he liked the weather the courses the food.
p231_418|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p231_419|the case will now go to appeal.
p231_420|even if they come out playing a physical game we can cope.
p231_421|there is a solution she believes.
p231_422|yet the data is compelling.
p231_423|it was important to win the singles.
p231_424|the road was closed for several hours.
p231_426|my aim is a top six finish.
p231_427|i would love to think that she could win.
p231_428|pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p231_429|he is on the wrong side.
p231_430|it was a breathtaking moment.
p231_431|i was in jail for five years.
p231_432|i never had a childhood.
p231_433|it is based on a true story.
p231_434|but it can be done.
p231_435|i never won a penny throughout my career.
p231_436|there will be no excuses on wednesday.
p231_437|the growth potential is enormous.
p231_438|they are not left wing.
p231_439|the british government does not want to know.
p231_440|they said they were only young men.
p231_441|we shall not forget him.
p231_442|the people are the hero.
p231_443|they made a huge impression on me.
p231_444|it's never easy to win an olympic gold medal.
p231_445|it sounded like a bomb.
p231_446|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p231_447|we've got a good management record.
p231_448|sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p231_449|and we might go back.
p231_450|we have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p231_451|we went straight into the bedroom.
p231_452|its future is no longer in question.
p231_453|we put our bid in last night.
p231_454|today he is in the same position as four years ago.
p231_456|they have to be met.
p231_457|we think a lot of allan mcgregor.
p231_458|she has reached the top of her profession.
p231_459|but he has a lifeline.
p231_460|a fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p231_461|they were good years for him.
p231_462|let that be their memorial.
p231_463|nine days later he suffered another attack.
p231_464|driving has been the key.
p231_465|she has now been registered as disabled.
p231_466|he is well respected by his colleagues.
p231_467|classes must be reduced by half.
p231_468|war is not the action.
p231_469|however he held out little hope that the government would take action.
p231_470|it is too early to speculate.
p231_471|dennis was not so sure.
p231_472|he felt it was the right time.
p231_473|it was clear on thursday.
p231_474|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p231_475|it was all in a short period of time.
p231_476|that was the first time i worked with richard.
p232_001|please call stella.
p232_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p232_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p232_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p232_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p232_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p232_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p232_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p232_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p232_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p232_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p232_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p232_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p232_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p232_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p232_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p232_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p232_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p232_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p232_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p232_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p232_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p232_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p232_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p232_025|johnson was pretty low.
p232_026|but it failed.
p232_027|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p232_028|they should be so lucky.
p232_029|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p232_030|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p232_031|it's a matter of balance.
p232_032|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p232_033|i would love it.
p232_034|it is marvellous.
p232_035|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p232_036|but it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p232_037|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p232_038|it was fit for royalty.
p232_039|i was scared.
p232_040|dancing was her life.
p232_041|i suspect the latter.
p232_042|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p232_043|but it took a lot of bottle.
p232_044|we will push.
p232_045|it is urgent.
p232_046|the judge said.
p232_047|it is difficult for ali.
p232_048|but it might have done.
p232_049|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p232_050|they had to explain it.
p232_051|here's a clue.
p232_052|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p232_053|it's the big omission.
p232_054|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p232_055|it's very odd.
p232_056|because we do not need it.
p232_057|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p232_058|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p232_059|that's the truth.
p232_060|that is very hard alone.
p232_061|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p232_062|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p232_063|you do not change overnight.
p232_064|people love to see this stuff.
p232_065|he was popular.
p232_066|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p232_067|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p232_068|it is like a river running by my home.
p232_069|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p232_070|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p232_071|painful but only because it's true.
p232_072|that was the easy election.
p232_073|there could be a way back.
p232_074|then followed a bout of flu.
p232_075|the price cuts are really exciting.
p232_076|i had my suspicions.
p232_077|it was chaotic.
p232_078|it is a job creation scheme.
p232_079|he is now resident in england.
p232_080|i've got the shirt.
p232_081|today she has been released.
p232_082|what has changed ?
p232_083|that is bound to happen.
p232_084|i will miss him.
p232_085|it's all going to clear the debt.
p232_086|she had kept the news from him.
p232_087|no progress has been made.
p232_088|others were in hiding in fear of their lives.
p232_089|now the system is right behind us.
p232_090|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p232_091|it is a lifeline.
p232_092|today i couldn't run on it.
p232_093|however it did not end that way.
p232_094|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p232_095|i have every confidence in raymond robertson as chairman of the party.
p232_096|then came the crunch.
p232_097|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p232_098|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p232_099|they were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p232_100|it was mayhem.
p232_101|they were outside the circle.
p232_102|it was a good performance.
p232_103|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p232_104|there will be no repeat of that performance that i can guarantee.
p232_105|that is no use.
p232_106|it was really enjoyable on saturday.
p232_107|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p232_108|he pleaded for caution.
p232_109|he plans to call for an aid package from mr macdonald.
p232_110|i don't have many friends.
p232_111|he was jailed for a year.
p232_112|you had better believe it.
p232_113|it's not fair.
p232_114|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p232_115|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p232_116|maybe this battle has been.
p232_117|mr chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p232_118|thereafter he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p232_119|this is the end of a chapter and this is very sad.
p232_120|it is rubbish.
p232_121|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p232_122|the whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p232_123|an announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p232_124|that's all right then.
p232_125|i'm so angry.
p232_126|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p232_127|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p232_128|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p232_129|the task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p232_130|offered the gold medal he declined.
p232_131|that first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p232_132|i am now unemployed.
p232_133|if not a deal could take many months.
p232_134|you've got to be vigilant.
p232_135|our intentions are real.
p232_136|they took a risk.
p232_137|the goals were good.
p232_138|what will happen then ?
p232_139|i am totally devoted to this job.
p232_140|he is severe.
p232_141|she died at her home.
p232_142|i do not want to have a fight with mr hastings.
p232_143|they did very well.
p232_144|the home side didn't stand a chance.
p232_145|we want to see the maximum of change.
p232_146|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p232_147|crucially though united were still alive.
p232_148|the departure of mr johnston was reported by the herald yesterday.
p232_149|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p232_150|she had gone to the catholic school.
p232_151|it's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p232_152|it was by the numbers.
p232_153|i was in daily contact.
p232_154|they were later discharged from hospital.
p232_155|this latter point is hugely important.
p232_156|it is an attitude of mind.
p232_158|they say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p232_159|we have to move forward.
p232_160|local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p232_161|we do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p232_162|tell it like it was ?
p232_163|it is not too late to get on board.
p232_164|that must be left to the parole board.
p232_165|again we were lucky.
p232_166|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p232_167|waiting times for these services are too long.
p232_168|that will do for me.
p232_169|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p232_170|we've made a couple of albums.
p232_171|my life has been destroyed.
p232_172|they thought they had found a home.
p232_173|it became a book by itself.
p232_174|i always felt they played for me.
p232_175|you have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p232_176|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p232_177|blair's response was weak.
p232_178|it's the real thing for sure.
p232_179|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p232_180|the event was held in the council's headquarters in hamilton.
p232_181|the clarity is vital.
p232_182|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p232_183|everyone can be bought.
p232_184|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p232_185|mr docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p232_186|it is the whole package.
p232_187|i've been there.
p232_188|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p232_189|they receive a high profile in the media.
p232_190|we did everything by the book.
p232_191|i wish i could say something.
p232_192|any change would be subject to the scottish parliament's approval.
p232_193|the procedure is the same in all cases.
p232_194|but a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p232_195|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p232_196|i came home by ambulance.
p232_197|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p232_198|the conference is the first test.
p232_199|the service from the other players was super.
p232_200|he's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p232_201|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p232_202|the sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p232_203|a deadline is still essential.
p232_204|we see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p232_205|it's a mixture of everything.
p232_206|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p232_207|i don't want to use it.
p232_208|now it's all right.
p232_209|there was an e mail.
p232_210|that's the day job.
p232_211|feel the heat ?
p232_212|he knows a lot.
p232_213|he is slightly confused.
p232_214|she should not be blamed.
p232_215|his third goal was superb.
p232_216|he would discuss the peace process in northern ireland.
p232_217|it's not ideal.
p232_218|he seemed to lose his focus.
p232_219|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p232_220|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p232_221|friends of the earth scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p232_223|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p232_224|that has been the easy part.
p232_225|we've got the bronze.
p232_226|mental health is a massive issue.
p232_227|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p232_228|it was good fun.
p232_229|what was the main difference ?
p232_230|i am immensely sad.
p232_231|i'd never seen a play about me.
p232_232|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p232_233|the track is currently covered in snow.
p232_234|but she was.
p232_235|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p232_236|we were awful.
p232_237|however no further action was taken by police.
p232_238|and thought we would get away with it.
p232_239|it is set in paris.
p232_240|the singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p232_241|it's quite nice.
p232_242|it's quite a line up
p232_243|it's a lovely lovely film.
p232_244|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p232_245|broke the birdie record.
p232_246|he claimed the government had lost the plot.
p232_247|she is well balanced.
p232_248|a change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p232_249|jock brown is appointed as general manager.
p232_250|he says that he is no different from any other man.
p232_251|manager bobby williamson has no injury worries.
p232_252|we did not compete with any other local farmer.
p232_253|i was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p232_254|some families have even requested to leave the city.
p232_255|it's a record label not a form of music.
p232_256|a friendship that will endure.
p232_257|i can't get a job.
p232_258|he said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p232_259|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p232_260|the bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p232_261|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p232_262|it does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
p232_263|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p232_264|the work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p232_265|blood samples were taken.
p232_266|they want to shut the scottish office.
p232_267|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p232_268|of course that is not the whole story.
p232_269|the government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p232_270|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p232_271|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p232_272|he is a young man with a new deal.
p232_273|he was also married with two children.
p232_274|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p232_275|lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p232_276|everything will fall into place it should be fine.
p232_277|she has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p232_278|they wanted the club to make money.
p232_279|finally he paid for the movie.
p232_280|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p232_281|it's a way of life.
p232_282|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p232_283|i am an estate agent.
p232_284|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p232_285|they were on holiday in egypt.
p232_286|it was a privilege to work for him.
p232_287|it happens from time to time.
p232_288|he looked very sharp.
p232_289|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p232_290|i saw it at a ruck.
p232_291|they were also beside themselves.
p232_292|the attacker died in the crash.
p232_293|the government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p232_294|a tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p232_295|police were on the scene within minutes but the killer had fled.
p232_296|he was obviously very genuine.
p232_297|these figures are truly awful.
p232_298|he should have won.
p232_299|he has retired.
p232_300|what has altered ?
p232_301|i thought it was my only chance.
p232_302|nothing is safe.
p232_303|he was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p232_305|they are wrong.
p232_306|it is a road of death.
p232_307|the confidence is low but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p232_308|we are in the end game.
p232_309|we are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p232_310|he was solid.
p232_311|special measures were needed.
p232_312|there is no other solution to congestion in edinburgh.
p232_313|i never thought it would take this long.
p232_314|we are a peaceful people.
p232_315|kids are terrible.
p232_316|it should be equal.
p232_317|craig is a major concern for us.
p232_318|the home team had an amazing start.
p232_319|for the moment our position remains the same.
p232_320|referees are easy targets.
p232_321|davis is very supportive as a director.
p232_322|however the groups denied the claims.
p232_323|i came into this world with nothing.
p232_324|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p232_325|off with their heads.
p232_326|it's not long enough.
p232_327|my view has now completely changed.
p232_328|they also recovered a picture of osama bin laden.
p232_329|we agreed to disagree.
p232_330|it could have gone either way.
p232_331|he was then replaced by ross.
p232_332|horses are drawn by ballot.
p232_333|i'd like to take the plunge.
p232_334|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p232_335|she did not attend the courtroom.
p232_336|it is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p232_337|his legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p232_338|the team for the first game could be this one.
p232_339|they haven't got a hope.
p232_340|who will do it ?
p232_341|gaelic provision continued to be good.
p232_342|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p232_343|he also insisted that no concessions had been made to the french.
p232_344|he has to learn.
p232_345|indeed it was magical.
p232_346|tiger is the exception.
p232_347|sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p232_348|that is the very reason why it was so vital.
p232_349|i could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p232_350|chambers said he would accept the place.
p232_351|everything was an effort.
p232_352|the boat was fantastic.
p232_353|like his acting it was an accident.
p232_354|it is long gone.
p232_355|on the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p232_356|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p232_357|he had played well in that central role.
p232_358|it's not that clear cut.
p232_359|she is free.
p232_360|it could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p232_361|i kept going for her.
p232_362|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p232_363|but the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p232_364|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p232_365|however it was well worth the wait.
p232_366|it benefits the whole family.
p232_367|he has seen the past.
p232_368|it was one in the afternoon.
p232_369|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p232_370|we will be homeless.
p232_371|the scene is about this ?
p232_372|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p232_373|mr anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p232_374|the group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p232_375|it was a double tragedy for the family.
p232_376|he could make it.
p232_377|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p232_378|the final decision was between scotland and the republic of ireland.
p232_379|they have not done so this season so far.
p232_380|i decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p232_381|well the big day has arrived.
p232_382|five members were disciplined.
p232_383|talks are progressing.
p232_384|there is no signature.
p232_385|i tried to be cautious but it's hard in that role.
p232_386|that left a bad taste in my mouth.
p232_387|it was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p232_388|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p232_389|it has moved on in the last week.
p232_390|that's the name of the game though.
p232_391|you thought it was a headache.
p232_392|building an underground for example has proved a nightmare.
p232_393|a council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p232_394|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p232_395|we're looking for justice.
p232_396|i can lead by example.
p232_397|i love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p232_398|but they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p232_399|pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p232_400|it will probably take me just days to spend it.
p232_401|it is legally binding.
p232_402|we knew nothing about it.
p232_403|my house was shaking at the time.
p232_404|this is a huge confidence boost.
p232_405|we have not yet received a letter from the irish.
p232_406|he was a crazy man.
p232_407|we should have known.
p232_408|feel the air the space.
p232_409|quality meat scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p232_410|i was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p232_411|you wanted the evidence.
p232_412|senior management in scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p232_413|it was that bad that low.
p232_414|i was very young.
p232_415|we have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p233_001|please call stella.
p233_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p233_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p233_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p233_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p233_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p233_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p233_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p233_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p233_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p233_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p233_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p233_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p233_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p233_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p233_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p233_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p233_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p233_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p233_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p233_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p233_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p233_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p233_025|we are a service industry.
p233_026|but we will have to wait.
p233_027|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p233_028|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p233_029|however the following year the cancer returned.
p233_030|on our numbers the price is in line with the asset value.
p233_032|last night mr robertson said he was delighted.
p233_033|this is a central issue.
p233_037|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p233_038|victory was never in doubt.
p233_039|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p233_040|we are the party of the future.
p233_041|i have never been a member of the council.
p233_042|he was in his element.
p233_043|that means an extra two years.
p233_044|at the moment we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p233_045|all businesses continue to trade.
p233_046|the man became a reporter.
p233_047|it depends on the decisions of the member states.
p233_048|it is all starting to come together.
p233_049|part of the complex is historic.
p233_050|the strategy is not without risk.
p233_051|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p233_052|i was released after six days.
p233_053|yesterday he was busy in his office.
p233_054|we are working on it.
p233_055|i've never been one for complaining about the press.
p233_056|this trend is likely to strengthen.
p233_057|still he did not let himself down this week.
p233_058|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p233_059|there was no safety net.
p233_060|he looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p233_061|you have to be patient.
p233_062|that is all in the past.
p233_063|that could be a mistake.
p233_064|it was an amazing result.
p233_065|indeed it is only the beginning.
p233_066|he has not been dropped.
p233_067|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p233_068|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p233_070|this time it might be for real.
p233_071|she did that for the rest of her life.
p233_072|seriously we are not concerned at all.
p233_073|it starts with the script.
p233_074|we were under a bit of pressure.
p233_075|the talks were announced yesterday by brian wilson the foreign office minister.
p233_076|we can all make a mistake.
p233_077|last night the move was bitterly denounced by france telecom.
p233_079|however he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p233_080|on the night it was not enough.
p233_081|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p233_082|however a ruling will not come before next week.
p233_083|they were badly prepared for it.
p233_084|it is not a story.
p233_085|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p233_086|how are you sir ?
p233_087|so is that it then ?
p233_088|do i have a favourite ?
p233_089|what do we do ?
p233_090|why do it otherwise ?
p233_091|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p233_092|they have a further report to make in march.
p233_093|he is in the us.
p233_094|the festival is prepared to help.
p233_095|by then he was walking on water.
p233_096|i had a bit in hand.
p233_097|we have to have a full statement to parliament.
p233_098|i cannot wait to get started on it.
p233_099|that is the fact of the matter.
p233_100|it should be a condition of employment.
p233_101|i had no intention of misleading anyone.
p233_102|it is much as it has been described.
p233_103|police said the family was helping with the search.
p233_104|she was there for the start of the campaign.
p233_105|he has become a monster.
p233_106|in fact he should never have been in the field.
p233_107|everyone had to play the game.
p233_108|in london today it was business as usual.
p233_109|it is not affected by the sale.
p233_110|we are currently working on the details.
p233_111|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p233_112|i thought it was a fantastic game.
p233_113|the picture is the same across scotland.
p233_114|it was the eighties.
p233_115|we do not expect any surplus.
p233_116|you had better believe it.
p233_117|holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p233_118|it's not a new concept in jazz.
p233_119|my office is bare.
p233_120|i'm delighted about that.
p233_121|i joined a group.
p233_122|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p233_123|who would be a referee?
p233_125|that's all right then.
p233_126|there were no grounds for his action.
p233_127|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p233_128|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p233_129|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p233_130|next season for every manager is a long time away.
p233_131|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p233_132|he's been the key to everything.
p233_133|it's an amazing landscape
p233_134|our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p233_135|tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p233_136|the trial is funded solely by edinburgh city council.
p233_137|i am now unemployed.
p233_138|customers for the panels include the national trust for scotland.
p233_139|yesterday mr hague dismissed the poll.
p233_140|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p233_141|mr hall is believed to have broken a leg.
p233_142|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p233_143|is that it ?
p233_144|i saw some terrible things.
p233_146|it seems so long since i did the exams.
p233_147|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p233_148|who would be right ?
p233_149|she died at her home.
p233_150|he felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p233_151|that could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p233_152|it is like a football team.
p233_153|it would be a last resort.
p233_154|initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p233_155|he will emerge as a world leader.
p233_156|it opens the door to the champions league.
p233_157|the home side didn't stand a chance.
p233_158|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p233_159|but he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p233_160|i was so nervous.
p233_161|of course we will need to strengthen the squad for europe.
p233_162|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p233_163|it is not normal practice.
p233_164|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p233_165|the attacker has been put in foster care.
p233_166|she also defended the lord chancellor's existing powers.
p233_167|neither side can win this war.
p233_168|alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p233_169|it is so unfair.
p233_170|i will tell you.
p233_171|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p233_172|they say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p233_173|i have got a wife to feed.
p233_174|it's that sort of night.
p233_175|mark fisher was a guest of the northern ireland tourist board.
p233_176|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p233_177|the release attracted little attention.
p233_178|waiting times for these services are too long.
p233_179|and i was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p233_180|we've made a couple of albums.
p233_181|they thought they had found a home.
p233_182|he will feel the pain again.
p233_183|i always felt they played for me.
p233_184|is saddam a threat ?
p233_185|i feel like my game has come a long way.
p233_186|the event was held in the council's headquarters in hamilton.
p233_187|if that's the case he will struggle.
p233_188|there is no evidence of a little scotland emerging.
p233_189|we are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p233_190|i was totally wrong.
p233_191|there is no point in looking any further.
p233_192|i've been there.
p233_193|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p233_194|it's a portrait of glasgow not the portrait.
p233_195|it's a joke.
p233_196|i had a train to catch.
p233_197|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p233_198|we are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p233_199|however this idea is never developed.
p233_200|it's very difficult to find a buyer.
p233_201|he may need it.
p233_203|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p233_204|it wasn't to be.
p233_208|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p233_209|i have a cold.
p233_210|he had suffered a heart attack.
p233_211|a deadline is still essential.
p233_212|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p233_213|it was worth a photograph.
p233_214|that will be vital.
p233_215|we need to handle it.
p233_216|the aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p233_217|i had relied on him.
p233_218|his third goal was superb.
p233_220|in each case they were a goal down.
p233_221|the fbi could become involved.
p233_222|work has started.
p233_223|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p233_224|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p233_225|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p233_226|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p233_228|mental health is a massive issue.
p233_229|you have to do your research.
p233_230|we played them off the pitch.
p233_231|the plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p233_232|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p233_233|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p233_234|my neighbours are horrified.
p233_235|but he failed to win the committee's support.
p233_236|i can't wait to meet him.
p233_237|broke the birdie record.
p233_238|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p233_239|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p233_240|the singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p233_241|a succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p233_242|we were extremely poor.
p233_243|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p233_244|chambers said he would accept the place.
p233_245|i know i'm in a very special position.
p233_246|we did not compete with any other local farmer.
p233_247|the salary changes are long overdue.
p233_248|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p233_249|it is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p233_250|there wasn't a goal.
p233_251|it was a cry for help.
p233_252|a friendship that will endure.
p233_253|this year i understood.
p233_254|her presence was almost everywhere.
p233_255|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p233_256|the distinction is also supported by doctors.
p233_257|i watched a game.
p233_258|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p233_259|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p233_260|i was happily surprised.
p233_261|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p233_262|it is also very valuable.
p233_263|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p233_264|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p233_265|it is not just about pay.
p233_266|their findings are published in the journal injury prevention.
p233_267|george w bush the us president condemned the attacks.
p233_268|blood samples were taken.
p233_269|they are never here.
p233_270|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p233_271|it looks as though he will be right.
p233_272|we showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p233_273|immediate action must be taken.
p233_274|he is a young man with a new deal.
p233_275|it was an easy decision to come here.
p233_276|it is the same in sweden.
p233_277|and michael was just great.
p233_278|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p233_279|everything will fall into place it should be fine.
p233_280|she has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p233_281|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p233_282|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p233_283|i feel pretty good.
p233_284|they were on holiday in egypt.
p233_285|it was a privilege to work for him.
p233_286|it was not hard to feel some sympathy for baxter yesterday.
p233_288|they were too hard.
p233_289|he looked very sharp.
p233_290|all options are open.
p233_291|the attacker died in the crash.
p233_292|it was a virus.
p233_294|i do not think this family will ever get over this.
p233_295|like his acting it was an accident.
p233_296|sunday's game was not a trial.
p233_297|who can predict ?
p233_298|this is a huge confidence boost.
p233_299|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p233_300|we have to sort it out ourselves.
p233_301|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p233_302|i thought it was my only chance.
p233_303|one was a lawyer.
p233_304|details of the new vessel were given in london yesterday.
p233_305|they should be swept away.
p233_306|this is a war over our home.
p233_307|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p233_308|i was in daily contact.
p233_309|we want to play at the worlds.
p233_310|this is the culture change in medicine.
p233_311|is there on his hands ?
p233_312|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p233_313|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p233_314|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p233_315|the problems began a long time ago.
p233_316|my body is clearly capable.
p233_317|we are very strongly behind the bid.
p233_319|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p233_320|my view has now completely changed.
p233_321|it shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p233_322|we agreed to disagree.
p233_323|on thursday mr blair will address the institute of public policy research.
p233_324|i saw some good things.
p233_325|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p233_326|robert is a special talent.
p233_327|it added to the spectacle.
p233_328|who was the mystery mp ?
p233_329|he told the court.
p233_330|the commitment was not long and it was worth the risk.
p233_331|who will do it ?
p233_332|however sharon rejected the claims.
p233_333|gaelic provision continued to be good.
p233_334|he also insisted that no concessions had been made to the french.
p233_335|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p233_336|the announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p233_337|sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p233_338|nobody else was with me.
p233_339|i've learned from my mistakes.
p233_340|i could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p233_341|the composer will conduct.
p233_342|i was pleased to be back on the podium in brazil.
p233_343|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p233_344|his contract was then not renewed.
p233_345|eight months later he was dead.
p233_346|on the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p233_347|he had played well in that central role.
p233_348|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p233_349|tyson is overwhelmed.
p233_350|however it was well worth the wait.
p233_351|he agreed with my proposal.
p233_352|hartley should know.
p233_353|mr anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p233_354|the group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p233_355|it is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p233_356|also it is the season of goodwill.
p233_357|equity declined to comment.
p233_358|you can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p233_359|he could make it.
p233_360|the criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p233_361|they have not done so this season so far.
p233_362|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p233_363|safety was also an issue.
p233_364|they received a reply from their own managers.
p233_365|but i managed.
p233_366|they play together perfectly.
p233_367|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p233_368|colour was at the core of his life.
p233_369|it was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p233_370|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p233_371|we shall not be moved.
p233_373|it was a hit.
p233_374|he's a nice guy.
p233_375|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p233_376|since then he has played no active part in the company.
p233_377|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p233_378|the mood was defiant.
p233_379|yet the data is compelling.
p233_381|it's just outrageous.
p233_382|the road was closed for several hours.
p233_383|it is unusual.
p233_384|that will come after the game on saturday.
p233_385|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p233_386|that set the tone.
p233_387|it was a breathtaking moment.
p233_388|i was in jail for five years.
p233_389|what happened in the summer ?
p233_390|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p233_391|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p233_392|he has not created a festival resource.
p234_001|please call stella.
p234_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p234_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p234_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p234_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p234_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p234_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p234_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p234_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p234_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p234_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p234_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p234_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p234_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p234_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p234_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p234_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p234_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p234_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p234_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p234_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p234_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p234_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p234_025|we are a service industry.
p234_026|but we will have to wait.
p234_027|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p234_028|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p234_029|however the following year the cancer returned.
p234_030|on our numbers the price is in line with the asset value.
p234_031|it is on the internet.
p234_032|last night mr robertson said he was delighted.
p234_033|this is a central issue.
p234_034|it's really no great surprise because the price difference is so much.
p234_035|history is in the making.
p234_036|it was sold at a loss.
p234_037|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p234_038|victory was never in doubt.
p234_039|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p234_040|we are the party of the future.
p234_041|i have never been a member of the council.
p234_042|he was in his element.
p234_043|that means an extra two years.
p234_044|at the moment we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p234_045|all businesses continue to trade.
p234_046|the man became a reporter.
p234_047|it depends on the decisions of the member states.
p234_048|it is all starting to come together.
p234_049|part of the complex is historic.
p234_050|the strategy is not without risk.
p234_051|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p234_052|i was released after six days.
p234_053|yesterday he was busy in his office.
p234_054|we are working on it.
p234_055|i've never been one for complaining about the press.
p234_056|this trend is likely to strengthen.
p234_057|still he did not let himself down this week.
p234_058|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p234_059|there was no safety net.
p234_060|he looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p234_061|you have to be patient.
p234_062|that is all in the past.
p234_063|that could be a mistake.
p234_064|it was an amazing result.
p234_065|indeed it is only the beginning.
p234_066|he has not been dropped.
p234_067|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p234_068|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p234_069|the market is appalling for initial public offerings.
p234_070|this time it might be for real.
p234_071|she did that for the rest of her life.
p234_072|seriously we are not concerned at all.
p234_073|it starts with the script.
p234_074|we were under a bit of pressure.
p234_075|the talks were announced yesterday by brian wilson the foreign office minister.
p234_076|we can all make a mistake.
p234_077|last night the move was bitterly denounced by france telecom.
p234_079|however he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p234_080|on the night it was not enough.
p234_081|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p234_082|however a ruling will not come before next week.
p234_083|they were badly prepared for it.
p234_084|it is not a story.
p234_085|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p234_086|how are you sir ?
p234_087|so is that it then ?
p234_088|do i have a favourite ?
p234_089|what do we do ?
p234_090|why do it otherwise ?
p234_091|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p234_092|they have a further report to make in march.
p234_093|he is in the us.
p234_094|the festival is prepared to help.
p234_095|by then he was walking on water.
p234_096|i had a bit in hand.
p234_097|we have to have a full statement to parliament.
p234_098|i cannot wait to get started on it.
p234_099|that is the fact of the matter.
p234_100|it should be a condition of employment.
p234_101|i had no intention of misleading anyone.
p234_102|it is much as it has been described.
p234_103|police said the family was helping with the search.
p234_104|she was there for the start of the campaign.
p234_105|he has become a monster.
p234_106|in fact he should never have been in the field.
p234_107|everyone had to play the game.
p234_108|in london today it was business as usual.
p234_109|it is not affected by the sale.
p234_110|we are currently working on the details.
p234_111|that would be decided at the interim results in november he added.
p234_112|that would be a serious problem.
p234_113|our action is not the end but the beginning of a process.
p234_114|people have been placed in a state of alarm.
p234_115|she is not a victim.
p234_116|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p234_117|and we had a good response.
p234_118|when we looked at the company.
p234_119|no the equipment is extra.
p234_120|for these people the ruling is very welcome.
p234_121|the announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p234_122|that admission is not surprising.
p234_123|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p234_124|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p234_125|there was a lot of resentment.
p234_126|he wanted to record the group.
p234_127|however it was a different story in the final.
p234_128|the end result is the same.
p234_129|three days later he was killed.
p234_130|we are committed to the ban.
p234_131|however the bank denied that he was in the running.
p234_132|the problem was a social problem.
p234_133|he had no money left to run the club.
p234_134|it is not so simple.
p234_135|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p234_136|so did she meet him ?
p234_137|so what is the campaign about ?
p234_138|and does it ?
p234_139|are you from the rugby ?
p234_140|actors like to be in the centre.
p234_141|when we played them last year we were beaten by the weather.
p234_142|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p234_143|here again they were denied a voice.
p234_144|overall it was a promising day for the scots.
p234_145|i can't even get into the a team.
p234_146|in addition investor choice is reduced.
p234_147|she does not want to speak.
p234_148|it is expected to last a week.
p234_149|full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p234_150|it is too pretty it is too small.
p234_151|as for the warning it was not needed.
p234_152|but it is different in different regions.
p234_153|that is the nature of the game.
p234_154|there is a spring in the step.
p234_155|we want to get there.
p234_156|he suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p234_157|i have a lot of confidence in this team.
p234_158|the players were under pressure.
p234_159|not that the occasion was without restraint.
p234_160|there is no common ground.
p234_161|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p234_162|in that case the children were not missing.
p234_163|frankly it was worth the booking.
p234_164|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p234_165|anyone can do the sums.
p234_166|at the moment we do not understand it.
p234_167|so far the scheme has not been used in scotland.
p234_168|it is not about the money it is about everything.
p234_169|five minutes later the home team were back in front.
p234_170|details will be published in the herald in the coming weeks.
p234_171|much of the equipment was new.
p234_172|i have had a good life.
p234_173|three hours later the man was free.
p234_174|that was the difference between the sides.
p234_175|they have not been named.
p234_176|i was in a hole.
p234_177|it is ambitious but it can be achieved.
p234_178|i was always in control.
p234_179|i would like to see the figures for the second quarter.
p234_180|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p234_181|he was asked to quit.
p234_182|there remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p234_183|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p234_184|they were not seeking the right to strike.
p234_185|he called for a public inquiry.
p234_186|tony blair has had a good conference.
p234_187|as indeed they would be.
p234_188|by then however both men were already in the us.
p234_189|it is simply not true.
p234_190|in light of things i think i made the right decision.
p234_191|it is not in the public interest.
p234_192|well this article is a bit like that.
p234_193|the performance is not there.
p234_194|it would make a lot of sense.
p234_195|at that point the structure of the board was changed.
p234_196|clearly they had other problems.
p234_197|he has defended the system.
p234_198|if that's the case he will struggle.
p234_199|i could not sit in the stands.
p234_200|at the top level the salaries are far too high.
p234_201|they have to get that sorted.
p234_202|yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
p234_203|we can take the city.
p234_204|are you going to win ?
p234_205|was it the wife ?
p234_207|what do we want to do that for ?
p234_208|does the name matter ?
p234_209|i will be in scotland.
p234_210|it was the story of the second half.
p234_211|the trading conditions are not good.
p234_212|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p234_213|equally he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p234_214|this is an interesting link.
p234_216|it was a management problem in the hospital.
p234_217|being investor ready is a good start.
p234_218|last night the company could not be contacted.
p234_219|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p234_220|this conference was never confirmed.
p234_221|however murray johnstone is not on the menu.
p234_222|we talk about mr michael johnson and he is awesome.
p234_223|he must have a crack at it.
p234_224|the force is with them.
p234_225|her experience is certainly limited.
p234_226|the deal is expected to be completed by september.
p234_227|however he said the money had not been wasted.
p234_228|mr blair was ready for him.
p234_229|we are waiting for the minister to come back with an answer.
p234_230|he intends to restart in the spring.
p234_231|he is a good friend.
p234_232|it is the strength of the school.
p234_233|but it may not be all bad news.
p234_234|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p234_235|the conference is the first test.
p234_236|indeed he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p234_237|but we are not immune to the problem.
p234_238|i was not overly concerned about this.
p234_239|however it is not as simple as this.
p234_240|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p234_241|a deadline is still essential.
p234_242|and they were being paid ?
p234_243|was everything done to save people ?
p234_244|what was the matter for concern ?
p234_245|do i think about them often ?
p234_246|is it in the right place ?
p234_247|did he trip ?
p234_248|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p234_249|you can buy them over the counter anywhere.
p234_250|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p234_251|we have an election in eight days.
p234_252|it was far from business as usual.
p234_253|it was just another play.
p234_254|from there they can go anywhere.
p234_255|the world is a good place.
p234_256|this is a sensible and common sense approach.
p234_257|the matter is under appeal.
p234_258|i am delighted for them.
p234_259|it was a great experience.
p234_260|they are difficult awards to decide.
p234_261|anyway the job will be part time.
p234_262|his second was a beauty.
p234_263|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p234_264|scotland played a major part in the project.
p234_265|investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p234_266|not in this production he doesn't.
p234_267|we can certainly build on this.
p234_268|then was the summer of their discontent.
p234_269|there is a world of difference.
p234_270|this would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p234_271|well it was certainly different.
p234_272|we want this place to work.
p234_273|clearly the stakes are high.
p234_274|so far the problems have occurred in the us.
p234_275|the statement contained no surprises.
p234_276|the performance continues to improve.
p234_277|that would be a danger.
p234_278|frankly we were lucky to get second.
p234_279|however no further action was taken by police.
p234_280|it depends on labour not on us.
p234_281|i had to be into it.
p234_282|my view has always been the same.
p234_283|in fact he is not even in the squad for the game.
p234_284|it is set in paris.
p234_285|do you think we're a top nation ?
p234_286|is our children learning ?
p234_287|how independent is that ?
p234_288|what form did that take ?
p234_289|are they free ?
p234_290|the party has never fully recovered.
p234_291|in many ways that is as important.
p234_292|his leader wanted to celebrate.
p234_293|it is not an option but a policy requirement.
p234_294|of further privacy he had no need.
p234_295|he was good but not that good.
p234_296|the results are expected within days.
p234_297|the company still had the confidence of its bankers he said.
p234_298|mr crawford is no stranger to scottish enterprise.
p234_299|we were well worth the win.
p234_300|and it was this one.
p234_301|but that's another story for another day.
p234_302|but it was also hard.
p234_303|if so it is a funny time to introduce it.
p234_304|we're looking for unity in the council.
p234_305|by then a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p234_306|they are not going the length of the pitch.
p234_307|however he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p234_308|the concerns are the same.
p234_309|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p234_310|scotland won by six wickets.
p234_311|it has to be enforced.
p234_312|and we can do it.
p234_313|every one is a winner.
p234_314|drugs are used a lot at the fishing not just cannabis.
p234_315|they have set the standard.
p234_316|this is a major property in edinburgh.
p234_317|it is a crisis of human rights a crisis of leadership.
p234_318|the existing structure is in trouble.
p234_319|it all started with a visiting rugby club.
p234_320|he refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
p234_321|you have to count on other people.
p234_322|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p234_323|and he's the real thing.
p234_324|what are they for ?
p234_325|is there a waiting list ?
p234_326|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p234_327|but it is important for a number of reasons.
p234_328|all of the management has invested in the firm.
p234_329|the family is not interested in the value of the house.
p234_330|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p234_331|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p234_332|but it can be done.
p234_333|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p234_334|we have to be very very careful.
p234_335|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p234_336|this could be a mistake.
p234_337|hopefully this week will be good.
p234_338|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p234_339|i think the overall picture is still strong.
p234_340|that is always a problem.
p234_341|we will deliver at director level.
p234_342|we did something about it.
p234_343|the market is the market.
p234_344|we do not have the papers.
p234_345|however the devil is in the detail.
p234_346|for the moment however the position is clear.
p234_347|the suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p234_348|the answer was in space.
p234_349|we are not interested in dividends.
p234_350|overall we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p234_351|his concern is only for the future.
p234_352|and it's a goodbye from him.
p234_353|they have to be addressed.
p234_354|if you can run a computer you can talk to the world.
p234_355|however a bid was never made.
p234_356|that is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p234_357|the city welcomed the numbers.
p234_358|something is going to have to give.
p234_359|there's still a bit to go.
p234_360|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p234_361|we never played at all.
p236_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p236_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p236_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p236_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p236_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p236_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p236_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p236_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p236_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p236_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p236_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p236_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p236_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p236_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p236_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p236_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p236_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p236_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p236_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p236_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p236_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p236_025|a shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p236_026|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p236_027|meetings will also remain private.
p236_028|because we do not need it.
p236_029|it's going to have a hell of an effect.
p236_030|and we have a singer.
p236_031|he was jailed for four years.
p236_032|he should emerge as the winner.
p236_033|this is a central issue.
p236_034|he works at the airport.
p236_035|it is not for any other purpose.
p236_036|if we cannot succeed in this endeavour then so be it.
p236_037|it carried a double message.
p236_038|that means an extra two years.
p236_039|that was the case with david.
p236_040|the staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p236_041|i needed a change a new challenge.
p236_042|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p236_043|their campaign is in disarray.
p236_044|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p236_045|we are working on it.
p236_046|he looks like an afghan.
p236_047|everything else is a bonus.
p236_048|europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p236_049|this is the interesting part.
p236_050|i haven't been ill at all.
p236_051|they just thought it was extremely good acting.
p236_052|that was the difference today.
p236_053|we keep an eye on it.
p236_054|the city welcomed the brighter outlook.
p236_055|we felt it was sufficient.
p236_056|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p236_057|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p236_058|you should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p236_059|but retail banking would be run from halifax.
p236_060|i have proved that in the past.
p236_061|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p236_062|i was very pleased with them today though.
p236_063|i was as strong as a horse.
p236_064|then followed a bout of flu.
p236_065|the talks were announced yesterday by brian wilson the foreign office minister.
p236_066|both men were on one year contracts.
p236_068|halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p236_069|it is a job creation scheme.
p236_070|he was seen as the enemy.
p236_071|it looks like a hit.
p236_072|these people are not big names.
p236_073|this view was echoed by the other scottish analyst.
p236_074|we did it for the jersey.
p236_075|the festival is prepared to help.
p236_076|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p236_077|by then he was walking on water.
p236_078|he was just a journalist.
p236_079|on saturday it was much the same.
p236_080|they lived for their children.
p236_081|we have turned the corner.
p236_083|the queen mother is dead.
p236_084|however the approach is not believed to be hostile.
p236_085|change will however have to be in euros.
p236_086|it was a big departure.
p236_087|does it matter ?
p236_088|how do you take them away ?
p236_089|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p236_090|after the match do you ?
p236_091|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p236_092|the vast bulk of its funds are run by aberdeen.
p236_093|it is open season on the old firm.
p236_094|the court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p236_095|i had a ball today.
p236_096|he refused to name the survivors.
p236_097|that time is not now however.
p236_098|we created so many chances.
p236_099|before the game we went for a pint.
p236_100|our house was very small.
p236_101|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p236_102|it became difficult for me.
p236_103|it's not a lack of effort.
p236_104|it is a total and utter change of culture.
p236_105|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p236_107|they will notice a difference.
p236_108|football is a passion for many.
p236_109|new year will be very busy.
p236_110|there's still plenty time left.
p236_111|the result is a vacuum.
p236_112|i've heard this stuff about the markets.
p236_113|you can spend money on housing.
p236_114|the hearing was due to continue today.
p236_115|i can't even get into the a team.
p236_116|in addition investor choice is reduced.
p236_117|but his attendance is not guaranteed.
p236_118|three hours later the man was free.
p236_119|which can happen any time.
p236_120|the colours are very pretty.
p236_121|he is a lovely man.
p236_122|becoming a father was wonderful.
p236_123|i was on a roll.
p236_124|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p236_125|something will be done by corporate bodies.
p236_126|he said to give a local injection.
p236_127|they made such decisions in london.
p236_128|you are a gambling man.
p236_129|before it was an ordeal.
p236_130|i love the spectacle of cinema.
p236_131|we will try to find someone.
p236_132|they could use a boost.
p236_133|she died at her home.
p236_134|i have a kind of love affair with hollywood.
p236_135|i enjoy the creative process.
p236_136|but the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p236_137|five minutes later the home team were back in front.
p236_138|it was a piece of art.
p236_139|that view has not altered.
p236_140|it's all change at kilmarnock.
p236_141|so i got a blood test.
p236_142|it has become a way of life.
p236_143|the whole industry is a shambles.
p236_144|like the others he was arrested.
p236_145|we will provide immediate access.
p236_146|he could do nothing about it.
p236_147|we have a clean bill of health.
p236_148|charles gordon leader of glasgow city council declined to comment.
p236_149|i was shaking on the blocks.
p236_151|it was by the numbers.
p236_152|it would seem a natural progression.
p236_153|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p236_154|this action reflects a slump in bookings.
p236_155|being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p236_156|it was a funny feeling.
p236_157|i'm afraid to say anything.
p236_158|we did what we had to do.
p236_159|it's not like us.
p236_161|it is not a financial issue.
p236_162|i have got a wife to feed.
p236_163|seven people were later detained by police.
p236_164|the striker needed attention before he could resume.
p236_165|we have a budget in march.
p236_166|he is not a team captain.
p236_167|greenwood said he was happy with that.
p236_168|overall the labour market continued to tighten.
p236_169|it opens the door to the champions league.
p236_170|that is not the case.
p236_172|it's nice to be nice.
p236_173|they could not match it.
p236_174|are they free ?
p236_175|what are they for ?
p236_176|is there a waiting list ?
p236_177|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p236_178|so what happens next ?
p236_179|had this been common practice ?
p236_180|what do they want us to do ?
p236_181|at that point the structure of the board was changed.
p236_182|one season they might do well.
p236_183|i feel like my game has come a long way.
p236_184|the hibs manager is no fool.
p236_185|it is not either national standards or local control.
p236_186|city sentiment is in his favour.
p236_187|the hotel was now for sale.
p236_188|we are the gateway to justice.
p236_189|tomorrow is a new day.
p236_190|it makes no influence on the public.
p236_191|each case is treated on merit.
p236_192|i have spoken to head office.
p236_193|says the duke of york.
p236_194|i had too much to drink.
p236_195|as many as the market will support.
p236_196|they need to look after themselves.
p236_197|that is a waste of energy.
p236_198|the report was welcomed by the law society of scotland.
p236_199|it could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
p236_200|i had a train to catch.
p236_201|it shows the strength of the roots.
p236_202|however murray johnstone is not on the menu.
p236_203|this youngster is so exciting
p236_204|we talk about mr michael johnson and he is awesome.
p236_205|it caused a lot of upset.
p236_206|motorists will buy passes in advance.
p236_207|my duty is to win.
p236_208|tony blair's official spokesman said.
p236_209|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p236_210|no details of the talks were given.
p236_211|this will be our new beginning.
p236_212|they have the cash and the fire power.
p236_213|the service from the other players was super.
p236_214|the early physical reports were clear.
p236_215|tommy is not a problem.
p236_216|the sanctions are about collective punishment.
p236_217|john daly has a burning ambition.
p236_218|a deadline is still essential.
p236_219|you have caught a serial killer.
p236_220|you are a great player.
p236_221|i won't make an official complaint.
p236_222|it was worth a photograph.
p236_223|they are looking at a flotation.
p236_224|which isn't a bad idea.
p236_225|there is no quick fix.
p236_226|there was a lot of resentment.
p236_227|that might help a bit.
p236_228|from there they can go anywhere.
p236_229|death is outside the language.
p236_230|i had relied on him.
p236_231|the course has helped a lot.
p236_232|i'm just a regular person.
p236_233|it had all been arranged.
p236_234|his third goal was superb.
p236_235|basically they have to come up with the offer.
p236_236|i am considered a teenager.
p236_237|anyway the job will be part time.
p236_238|this will secure the future of our industry.
p236_239|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p236_240|people should make their own decisions.
p236_241|they said that they stood by their statement.
p236_242|you have to do your research.
p236_243|we played them off the pitch.
p236_244|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p236_245|truth is the child of time.
p236_246|and they were being paid ?
p236_247|was everything done to save people ?
p236_249|do i think about them often ?
p236_250|that wasn't an outstanding performance from celtic.
p236_251|a small number of new jobs will also be created.
p236_252|it's important to get it right.
p236_253|pensions are a long term investment.
p236_254|those overseas offices were great.
p236_255|on wednesday it is the turn of cable wireless.
p236_256|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p236_257|i was just a kid.
p236_258|he was good but not that good.
p236_259|it was quite a new prescription.
p236_260|it is very hard for her.
p236_261|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p236_262|it is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
p236_263|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p236_264|clearly the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p236_265|you can feel at home in china.
p236_266|either way the investor retains the premium.
p236_267|the calls were last night rejected by the us and the uk.
p236_268|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p236_269|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p236_270|but they were never expected to last.
p236_271|however he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p236_272|the capital costs are modest.
p236_273|i told you i was ill.
p236_274|he will go on the bench.
p236_275|that could be in place by next year.
p236_276|we accept the new rules.
p236_277|we run within the law.
p236_278|we have the moral high ground.
p236_279|he took over our lives.
p236_280|it has all been done in secret.
p236_281|they must play for each other.
p236_282|drugs are used a lot at the fishing not just cannabis.
p236_283|she always wanted her own way.
p236_284|i realised i was lucky to have it.
p236_285|they can leave at any time.
p236_286|much of the equipment was new.
p236_287|blair also had a penalty.
p236_288|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p236_289|frankly we should all have such problems.
p236_290|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p236_291|my body is a wreck.
p236_292|she failed in her action.
p236_293|stephen will get his first cap.
p236_294|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p236_295|and that match was played in june.
p236_296|i saw it at a ruck.
p236_297|what do we want to do that for ?
p236_298|does the name matter ?
p236_299|how do you get it back ?
p236_300|what are you not good at ?
p236_301|i think therefore i am ?
p236_302|it's all designed to speed up the service.
p236_303|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p236_304|he will address the nation this evening.
p236_305|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p236_306|maloney is an engaging talent.
p236_307|the rescue package is public money.
p236_308|i was there five months ago.
p236_309|i am a retailer by nature.
p236_310|his job was not advertised.
p236_311|we can work all night.
p236_312|it was really very frightening.
p236_313|it was an excellent performance.
p236_314|the answer is with ourselves.
p236_315|and we can do it.
p236_316|these figures are truly awful.
p236_317|that is the real test.
p236_318|they have to be addressed.
p236_319|it aims to produce its report before christmas.
p236_320|cast away now on general release.
p236_321|all winners should be tested.
p236_322|i can live with it.
p236_323|a lot has been written.
p236_324|and he goes with it.
p236_325|the law will take its course.
p236_326|this is a historic occasion.
p236_327|this ruling is a farce.
p236_328|after some discussion they did.
p236_329|i am not obsessed with sex.
p236_330|i didn't have the reply.
p236_331|public opinion was split on the proposal.
p236_332|these days will be back.
p236_333|you may have a short memory.
p236_335|there was no time scale.
p236_336|that decision has already been made.
p236_337|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p236_338|the game is now open.
p236_339|the tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p236_340|even the one she loved.
p236_341|finally he paid for the movie.
p236_342|it was almost too much.
p236_343|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p236_344|the idea was first mooted a year ago.
p236_345|three years ago he would have been.
p236_346|it's a policy which has worked for us.
p236_347|we think a lot of allan mcgregor.
p236_348|the confidence isn't there now.
p236_349|we put our bid in last night.
p236_350|a great deal has been achieved.
p236_351|he had no previous convictions.
p236_352|alex ferguson is the same.
p236_353|what do we do ?
p236_354|why do it otherwise ?
p236_355|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p236_356|so did she meet him ?
p236_357|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p236_358|like his acting it was an accident.
p236_359|scotland is the home of golf.
p236_360|they have broken that promise.
p236_361|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p236_362|it's only a matter of scale.
p236_363|we must put a marker down.
p236_364|she said they would appeal.
p236_365|there is no deal as yet.
p236_366|it's as wide as a church in here.
p236_367|the work with alison was a great experience.
p236_368|it was like a weekly wage.
p236_369|we are a scottish company.
p236_370|they will fight for everything.
p236_371|the pair are very much in love.
p236_372|we used to keep our business rates.
p236_373|everything is now in place for manchester.
p236_374|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p236_375|everyone could see the joke.
p236_376|all would be under threat.
p236_377|i understand the frustration of the fans.
p236_378|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p236_379|the seller was not revealed.
p236_380|people are on the alert.
p236_381|i can confirm that miss deacon has received a threatening phone call.
p236_382|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p236_383|a review is under way.
p236_384|they know it'll be fantastic.
p236_385|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p236_386|clark is back on top form.
p236_387|motion described it as a unique event.
p236_388|it brought in new management.
p236_389|my view has now completely changed.
p236_390|she is in their hands.
p236_391|the following day i used the story.
p236_392|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p236_393|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p236_394|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p236_395|i should think so too.
p236_396|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p236_397|how are you sir ?
p236_398|so is that it then ?
p236_399|do i have a favourite ?
p236_400|it certainly appeared that way.
p236_401|i didn't know that i had a court appearance on wednesday.
p236_402|we can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p236_403|i will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
p236_404|i remain a buyer of the shares.
p236_405|but demand for space in edinburgh is still strong.
p236_406|it had been on the cards.
p236_407|he seems to be used to the attention.
p236_408|the trick is to try it.
p236_409|i would love to think that she could win.
p236_410|he may have a point.
p236_411|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p236_412|he repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p236_413|he is on the wrong side.
p236_414|my husband was born in zimbabwe.
p236_415|i've got my own ideas.
p236_416|i never had a childhood.
p236_417|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p236_418|i think it's a miracle.
p236_419|they were not complacent in any way.
p236_420|they did the right thing.
p236_421|he will be judged by his actions.
p236_422|the fate of the rest is unknown.
p236_423|it is an absolute nonsense.
p236_424|young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
p236_425|sadly the surface was a nightmare.
p236_426|everything in golf is a balance.
p236_427|it is a case of pity for us.
p236_428|i believe the gap is nearly there.
p236_429|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p236_430|we've got a good management record.
p236_431|it was that bad that low.
p236_432|paris is not only young.
p236_433|however the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
p236_434|but you can go beyond that condition.
p236_435|but we have built a platform for next season.
p236_436|it looked like a war zone.
p236_437|he said current trading was strong.
p236_438|i chose to make a film.
p236_439|i can tell you labour is fighting to win.
p236_440|but by that time it was too late.
p236_441|the damage is all inside.
p236_442|nine days later he suffered another attack.
p236_443|we would have concerns about that.
p236_444|i know the worry over iraq.
p236_445|taxes may need to rise.
p236_446|equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p236_447|phil mickelson did that last year.
p236_448|no options are excluded at all.
p236_449|the event was held in the council's headquarters in hamilton.
p236_450|we are going for it.
p236_451|miss jackson was not present to put her case.
p236_452|it is a cause for concern.
p236_453|the weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p236_454|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p236_455|he deserved a red card.
p236_456|they were not even allowed to see them.
p236_457|and she is very clear on this.
p236_458|and it covers the spectrum.
p236_459|dennis was not so sure.
p236_460|the chief constable has retired.
p236_461|it will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p236_462|it is a crisis without a doubt.
p236_463|not if you know the person.
p236_464|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p236_465|i was all image and no substance.
p236_466|the boys are mentally focused.
p236_467|it can all be done over the phone.
p236_468|the bill would be massive.
p236_469|when people talk about the beach boys and brian wilson.
p236_470|neither woman has been named.
p236_471|he was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p236_472|we live by the rule of law.
p236_473|they make a selective perception process.
p236_474|he was a shooting star.
p236_475|i could feel the blood on my face.
p236_476|i am a committed european.
p236_477|analysts said the offer was fair.
p236_478|these people attack the core of my beliefs.
p236_479|then came the farewell to europe.
p236_480|it is a vicious circle.
p236_481|he will be advised by me.
p236_482|winning a medal is a dream.
p236_483|we had to add value.
p236_484|that is the bottom line.
p236_485|it happens on an annual basis.
p236_486|however he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
p236_487|we have to go for a win.
p236_488|it worked well in monaco.
p236_489|something has got to change.
p236_490|i had it before the final.
p236_491|our fans have been marvellous.
p236_492|the bbc was a disgrace.
p236_493|i would put my money on peter donald.
p236_494|it was still there but right at the end.
p236_495|the prime minister has been in touch.
p236_496|they never gave up hope.
p236_497|he had planned to sell it.
p236_498|i was ready for this.
p236_499|in fact we were all over the shop.
p236_500|a scotsman has to defend his castle.
p236_501|our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p236_502|i stayed away from the defence.
p236_503|lord sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p237_001|please call stella.
p237_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p237_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p237_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p237_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p237_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p237_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p237_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p237_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p237_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p237_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p237_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p237_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p237_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p237_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p237_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p237_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p237_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p237_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p237_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p237_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p237_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p237_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p237_025|he said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p237_026|they should be so lucky.
p237_027|i have a theory.
p237_028|they should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p237_029|the appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p237_030|however the following year the cancer returned.
p237_031|we want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p237_032|there's a story too.
p237_033|this is the window.
p237_034|i think a move would create a lot of interest.
p237_035|i'd like to continue that record.
p237_036|they're just different.
p237_037|it was clear.
p237_038|it is not for any other purpose.
p237_039|the problem is the pitch.
p237_040|it's a great thing.
p237_041|he did not know his daughter.
p237_042|this film will be totally awesome.
p237_043|that is a break with tradition.
p237_044|it's the only thing.
p237_045|it is so sad.
p237_046|there will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p237_047|it is urgent.
p237_048|i feel pretty good.
p237_049|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p237_050|it is bizarre.
p237_051|that should do it.
p237_052|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p237_053|she looked so young.
p237_054|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p237_055|life is good.
p237_056|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p237_057|i was inspired by two things.
p237_058|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p237_059|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p237_060|new york is expected to come to a standstill.
p237_061|i've had six days of rehearsal.
p237_062|none has ever been found.
p237_063|it's a real challenge.
p237_064|you do not change overnight.
p237_065|art is extra.
p237_066|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p237_067|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p237_068|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p237_069|it is like a river running by my home.
p237_070|we have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p237_071|try to save us.
p237_072|the end result is precisely the same.
p237_073|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p237_074|painful but only because it's true.
p237_075|i was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p237_076|the price cuts are really exciting.
p237_077|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p237_078|it is a terrible place.
p237_079|two israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p237_080|it may well have been.
p237_081|it's all going to clear the debt.
p237_082|i first met him last summer.
p237_083|he is driven.
p237_084|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p237_085|someone who cares
p237_086|it's never too late.
p237_087|others were in hiding in fear of their lives.
p237_088|lord levy said he started life with nothing.
p237_089|now the system is right behind us.
p237_090|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p237_091|today i couldn't run on it.
p237_092|however it did not end that way.
p237_093|we must look forward.
p237_094|i have every confidence in raymond robertson as chairman of the party.
p237_095|until you hit the big games.
p237_096|we could not get any possession.
p237_097|i love the dome.
p237_098|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p237_099|by that time however it was already too late.
p237_100|they were outside the circle.
p237_101|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p237_102|but it was a pleasure.
p237_103|it was some time before she found out he was safe.
p237_104|we want to get to the final anyway.
p237_105|i didn't play well last year.
p237_106|health secretary frank dobson made the surprise announcement in the commons yesterday.
p237_107|they had to be cut from the wreckage.
p237_108|i did not think about the ryder cup.
p237_109|it is normal.
p237_110|further protests are likely.
p237_111|it's in his blood.
p237_112|who would be right ?
p237_113|it's a shame.
p237_114|i came to complete.
p237_117|this is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p237_118|on this showing they should stick with the lads.
p237_119|until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p237_120|does this mean.
p237_121|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p237_122|it is a delight on every level.
p237_123|an announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p237_124|i felt very strongly that england should have it.
p237_125|but it took a lot of bottle.
p237_126|i thought it was a fantastic game.
p237_127|i'm so angry.
p237_128|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p237_129|she really suffered for her art.
p237_130|it's terrible that he has died the same way.
p237_131|buckingham palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p237_132|offered the gold medal he declined.
p237_133|who will attend ?
p237_134|the trial is funded solely by edinburgh city council.
p237_135|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p237_136|they made such decisions in london.
p237_137|it's perfectly feasible.
p237_138|they took a risk.
p237_139|the scottish socialist party is also expected to attend.
p237_140|the judges will give a ruling next wednesday.
p237_141|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p237_142|he has the edge.
p237_143|three penalties were given.
p237_144|it seems so long since i did the exams.
p237_145|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p237_146|she hopes to study in britain one day.
p237_147|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p237_148|he is severe.
p237_149|she died at her home.
p237_150|is that titanic ?
p237_151|the idea is simple.
p237_153|he will emerge as a world leader.
p237_154|it opens the door to the champions league.
p237_155|it's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p237_156|it is huge.
p237_157|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p237_159|it is not normal practice.
p237_160|last night he was due to hold talks with arafat.
p237_161|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p237_162|it's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p237_163|we are now up against it.
p237_164|i was in daily contact.
p237_165|he was the bill gates of theatre.
p237_166|the weather affected the other two games in fife.
p237_167|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p237_168|they should stop the bombing.
p237_169|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p237_170|it could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p237_171|i was in the train station overnight.
p237_172|we knew we had the goal we wanted.
p237_173|he is keen to stay in public service.
p237_174|i looked again at its vision for a scottish parliament.
p237_175|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p237_176|does that put pressure on us ?
p237_177|the release attracted little attention.
p237_178|waiting times for these services are too long.
p237_179|he was a crazy man.
p237_180|a helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p237_181|mr blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p237_182|one season they might do well.
p237_183|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p237_184|this is a sad day.
p237_185|the event was held in the council's headquarters in hamilton.
p237_186|the hotel was now for sale.
p237_187|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p237_188|government will intervene.
p237_189|four policemen were wounded.
p237_190|they receive a high profile in the media.
p237_191|it's a joke.
p237_192|miller was every bit as happy.
p237_193|i wish i could say something.
p237_194|it is tough but possible.
p237_195|i've got good news and bad news for you.
p237_196|we are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p237_198|if the director is with you.
p237_199|the spokeswoman said the flat in london was very small.
p237_200|it is a case of taking a risk.
p237_201|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p237_202|our strategy is straightforward.
p237_203|is that success ?
p237_204|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p237_205|tommy is not a problem.
p237_206|the sisters also became the two top players in the world.
p237_207|he was also married with two children.
p237_208|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p237_210|it seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p237_211|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p237_212|i don't want to use it.
p237_213|now it's all right.
p237_214|there was an e mail.
p237_215|failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p237_216|it is a gamble.
p237_217|he is slightly confused.
p237_218|she should not be blamed.
p237_219|i began to pray.
p237_220|i had decided to quit the show.
p237_221|i do not want to have a fight with mr hastings.
p237_222|by hard work is the answer.
p237_223|the fbi could become involved.
p237_224|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p237_225|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p237_226|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p237_227|you have to do your research.
p237_228|william hague delighted his party.
p237_229|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p237_230|clearly the stakes are high.
p237_231|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p237_232|i am immensely sad.
p237_233|i'd never seen a play about me.
p237_234|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p237_235|i can't wait to meet him.
p237_236|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p237_237|they are the innocent victims.
p237_238|jim leighton will play in the scottish cup final.
p237_239|the way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p237_240|you take a risk.
p237_241|they tried to give her advice.
p237_242|police later said the scheme would end in november.
p237_243|it's a dead end.
p237_244|we are in the hat.
p237_245|of course that is not the whole story.
p237_246|they should come forward.
p237_247|it is not the message alone.
p237_248|wednesday night was a difficult time for britton.
p237_249|he says that he is no different from any other man.
p237_250|it's quite a line up
p237_251|it's a lovely lovely film.
p237_252|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p237_253|we were extremely poor.
p237_254|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p237_255|we have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p237_256|it would appear that it has not been a problem.
p237_257|chambers said he would accept the place.
p237_258|both reports appear in the british medical journal.
p237_259|you can feel at home in china.
p237_260|our decision making was poor.
p237_262|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p237_263|they are different types.
p237_264|there's the mix.
p237_265|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p237_266|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p237_267|scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p237_268|that could be in place by next year.
p237_270|special measures were needed.
p237_271|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p237_272|this is a big club.
p237_273|blair is very positive at european councils.
p237_274|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p237_275|i have never been a close friend of jim mclean.
p237_276|it is also very valuable.
p237_277|the work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p237_278|the warning is timely.
p237_279|it is a crisis of human rights a crisis of leadership.
p237_280|that decision is for the british parliament and people.
p237_281|there is no link.
p237_282|this is a question of islam.
p237_283|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p237_284|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p237_285|immediate action must be taken.
p237_286|frankly we should all have such problems.
p237_287|we're in shock.
p237_288|you know the type.
p237_289|she failed in her action.
p237_290|he promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p237_291|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p237_292|they seem to get away with it.
p237_293|people have no choice.
p237_294|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p237_295|i saw it at a ruck.
p237_296|i intended to look for another club on loan.
p237_297|mr campbell received a phone call.
p237_298|holland won by five wickets.
p237_299|she said she could not believe that they had run away.
p237_300|it shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p237_301|that could change.
p237_302|he should have won.
p237_303|who can predict ?
p237_304|the move was welcomed by the roman catholic church in scotland.
p237_305|we have to sort it out ourselves.
p237_306|i was the sheep.
p237_307|graeme was prepared.
p237_308|however he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p237_309|it is a road of death.
p237_310|this is a war over our home.
p237_311|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p237_312|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p237_313|they were on holiday in egypt.
p237_314|i was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p237_315|scotland has shown the way.
p237_316|it wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p237_317|it is no surprise.
p237_318|we want to play at the worlds.
p237_320|they were fantastic.
p237_321|i never thought it would take this long.
p237_322|they wanted the club to make money.
p237_323|it should be equal.
p237_325|we are very strongly behind the bid.
p237_326|in the old days it was easy.
p237_327|the parents will have a great time too.
p237_328|it is a job creation scheme.
p237_329|i am so upset.
p237_330|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p237_331|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p237_332|it was no secret that i wanted to sign him.
p237_333|he was then replaced by ross.
p237_334|i saw some good things.
p237_335|he can do no wrong.
p237_337|her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p237_338|there was a bit of urgency in the second half.
p237_339|they haven't got a hope.
p237_340|it has moved on in the last week.
p237_341|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p237_342|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p237_343|he also insisted that no concessions had been made to the french.
p237_344|the train was on time.
p237_345|they made clear that they are not interested in government assistance.
p237_346|the announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p237_347|indeed it was magical.
p237_348|look at the witnesses.
p237_349|nobody else was with me.
p237_350|the composer will conduct.
p237_351|it should be scrapped.
p238_001|please call stella.
p238_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p238_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p238_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p238_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p238_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p238_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p238_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p238_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p238_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p238_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p238_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p238_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p238_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p238_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p238_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p238_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p238_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p238_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p238_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p238_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p238_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p238_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p238_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p238_025|smoking is also very important.
p238_026|the first appeared to be successful.
p238_027|we must convince the citizens.
p238_028|there was a rush of water.
p238_029|last night mr robertson said he was delighted.
p238_030|further management changes are planned.
p238_031|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p238_032|the staff are very good.
p238_033|mr darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p238_034|overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p238_035|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p238_036|let there be no doubt about that.
p238_037|the ambition this year is to improve on last.
p238_038|alliance leicester would give it a presence in southern england.
p238_039|and so was a photograph.
p238_040|i remember that day well.
p238_041|she became a heroine of my childhood.
p238_042|we want to get back into the champions league.
p238_043|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p238_044|it is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
p238_045|this represents a tough game for us.
p238_046|separate approvals would be needed for these.
p238_047|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p238_048|among them are many criminals.
p238_049|it comes from reflection or thinking.
p238_050|the whole thing was filmed in hollywood.
p238_051|and they removed a borderer.
p238_052|he is too weak to move.
p238_053|does it matter ?
p238_054|how do you take them away ?
p238_055|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p238_056|after the match do you ?
p238_057|has the conflict started ?
p238_058|have i really come to this ?
p238_059|they desperately want some stability.
p238_060|well he is an artist.
p238_061|we work for the athlete.
p238_062|he looks like an afghan.
p238_063|everything else is a bonus.
p238_064|he will need that machine.
p238_065|we hadn't really taken that seriously before.
p238_066|it's the performance we want.
p238_067|then they scored two goals to win.
p238_068|in fact it was geoffrey robinson.
p238_069|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p238_070|the labour party's not downbeat and neither is the labour government.
p238_071|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p238_072|i had relied on him.
p238_073|and then there's the racial hassle.
p238_074|we felt it was sufficient.
p238_075|the wingers must have felt the cold.
p238_076|i am relishing the challenge.
p238_077|i have made that offer.
p238_078|no plans for projects are yet in place.
p238_079|but the organisers refused to worry.
p238_080|we have to keep our clients.
p238_081|we should be able to cope.
p238_082|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p238_083|the two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p238_084|he's very young and very keen to do well.
p238_085|it is somewhere to be.
p238_086|we should all be grateful.
p238_087|we will pay their bills.
p238_088|it was exactly four months away.
p238_089|this is equally relevant to the landowner.
p238_090|he thought she was amazing.
p238_091|the result is utterly compelling.
p238_092|final proposals will be published in february.
p238_093|he seems to have everything.
p238_094|there can be no compromise on welfare.
p238_095|it wasn't possible to relax.
p238_096|he was at home with his pals.
p238_097|i was very pleased with them today though.
p238_098|maybe this battle has been.
p238_099|then followed a bout of flu.
p238_100|both sides have been hit by injury.
p238_101|it will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
p238_102|it's very dangerous for markets.
p238_103|the fans would love it.
p238_104|that would be the case with dundee.
p238_105|brian wilson is a former member to watch award winner.
p238_106|talk of a crisis is absurd.
p238_107|their mandate is to target inflation.
p238_108|we have thought about doing lots of things.
p238_109|england were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p238_110|this is a milestone in the modernisation of the scottish prosecution service.
p238_111|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p238_112|harrowing is easy after all.
p238_113|those people must be accountable.
p238_114|if they liked it then i'll be happy.
p238_115|it's very bad timing but it's happened.
p238_116|accordingly financial restructuring is required.
p238_117|many others are subjected to violence by men.
p238_118|it's going to be epic.
p238_119|what form did that take ?
p238_120|are they free ?
p238_121|what are they for ?
p238_122|is there a waiting list ?
p238_123|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p238_124|so what happens next ?
p238_125|had this been common practice ?
p238_126|what do they want us to do ?
p238_127|basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p238_128|he put some colour into scottish history.
p238_129|they lived for their children.
p238_130|potions said he would drive.
p238_131|this is a sizeable part of our business.

p238_136|western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p238_137|i won't make an official complaint.
p238_138|monty is great in his own backyard.
p238_139|brown also believes in walker's innocence.
p238_140|this might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p238_141|even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
p238_142|the outsourcing deal will take effect in september.
p238_143|but it looks good for next year.
p238_144|all the employees are redundant.
p238_145|his claims were criticised by chief secretary to the treasury andrew smith.
p238_146|four meetings have previously been arranged.
p238_147|colin said you get through the day to day by looking at the future.
p238_148|the tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p238_149|and they all have a vote.
p238_150|it is a vicious circle.
p238_151|gordon marshall was outstanding against us.
p238_152|drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p238_154|they make a selective perception process.
p238_155|that's what happened against ayr.
p238_156|hopefully no one will suffer too badly.
p238_157|the following are the principal provisions.
p238_158|but his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p238_159|therefore this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p238_160|his job was not advertised.
p238_161|he was just like a godfather to it.
p238_162|the milk industry is in turmoil.
p238_163|he plans to call for an aid package from mr macdonald.
p238_164|yet the survey has been cautious.
p238_165|the arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p238_166|you cannot blame the turnout.
p238_167|we can't get over it.
p238_168|they almost achieved a draw.
p238_169|i can see it now.
p238_170|this is a step backwards.
p238_171|i've no idea how it works.
p238_172|we continue to hold the shares.
p238_173|the festivals will be about having fun.
p238_174|emergency services were also on stand by outside.
p238_175|thereafter he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p238_176|hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p238_177|the changes took effect from june.
p238_178|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.

p238_182|the head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p238_183|again he dismissed a merger with halifax.

p238_185|but we could only help a handful of people.
p238_186|scottish football is finally on its way back.
p238_187|this is a frightening development.
p238_188|he is survived by his wife and two sons.
p238_189|this should begin in october.
p238_190|you just have to accept.
p238_191|there is no evidence that these people are helpful.
p238_192|the yugoslav army will still be there.
p238_193|the squad is too small.
p238_194|he has had success at every level.
p238_195|this patton will also return.
p238_196|tiger is not the norm.
p238_197|his words were not audible.
p238_198|you are a gambling man.
p238_199|did he trip ?
p238_200|does that put pressure on us ?
p238_201|did it work ?
p238_202|do you think we are a top nation ?
p238_203|is our children learning ?
p238_204|how independent is that ?
p238_206|truth is the child of time.
p238_207|there was a fine line to tread.
p238_208|the refund is fully justified.
p238_209|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p238_211|but experts have disputed that statistic.
p238_212|it is time for confession.
p238_213|he has many offers from the english premiership.
p238_214|hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
p238_215|in general terms the proposals are very much in line with expectations.

p238_218|we will try to find someone.

p238_220|frankly it was worth the booking.
p238_221|the study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p238_222|people have been wonderful beyond belief.
p238_223|we were right to be afraid.
p238_224|the music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p238_225|that group reported just before christmas.
p238_226|i am considered a teenager.
p238_227|their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p238_228|arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p238_229|that view has not altered.
p238_230|its's all change at kilmarnock.
p238_231|so i got a blood test.
p238_232|no one from the fire brigades union was available for comment yesterday.
p238_233|others may have but i'm a fighter.
p238_234|there's always the next century.
p238_235|for businesses the benefits will be enormous.
p238_236|that proved enough to settle the home side down.
p238_237|here was an anti supporting the bill.
p238_238|five years later the deception continued.
p238_239|analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p238_240|there's only one team in ayrshire.
p238_241|crucially though united were still alive.
p238_242|it is not normal practice.
p238_243|it is crucial for both teams.
p238_244|mr blair had done well.
p238_245|i was a lucky man tonight.
p238_246|then we will face the danish champions.
p238_247|but it couldn't happen overnight.
p238_248|it would seem a natural progression.
p238_249|meanwhile the search continues for ferguson's replacement.
p238_250|my dad is a hero.
p238_251|and they were being paid ?
p238_252|was everything done to save people ?
p238_253|what was the matter for concern ?
p238_254|do i think about them often ?
p238_255|is it in the right place ?
p238_256|this wasn't just a big crowd.
p238_257|it was a terrible combination of factors.
p238_258|this is absolutely not true.
p238_259|arsenal refused to be evicted.
p238_260|it's about time something was done about equipment.
p238_261|they should stop the bombing.
p238_262|alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p238_263|not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p238_264|it is a terrible tragedy.
p238_265|the agreement remains the only show in town.
p238_266|the question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p238_267|the strong performance is expected to continue.
p238_268|the internet is no substitute for customer service.
p238_269|it was a bit of a tightrope.
p238_270|it's never great to finish second.
p238_271|i'm delighted that celtic have done so well this season.
p238_272|her political persuasion is no secret.
p238_273|initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p238_274|he is a right bastard.
p238_275|bobby williamson has been brilliant.
p238_276|they could not match it.
p238_277|he is not a pathetic figure.
p238_278|the feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p238_279|i came up through the ranks.
p238_280|you've got to be vigilant.
p238_281|first the programme was unbalanced.
p238_282|the happiness was slightly misplaced.
p238_283|phase one was a shambles.
p238_284|this championship is different from the other majors.
p238_285|but i was glad to see these interviews.
p238_286|each case is treated on merit.
p238_287|they are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p238_288|says the duke of york.
p238_289|he is a serial conservative assassin.
p238_290|we've just had it confirmed.
p238_291|even more harrowing though was the reception from her husband and manager.
p238_292|downing street insisted we have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p238_293|she is currently the permanent secretary at the department of transport.
p238_294|we've had great things in the past.
p238_295|it has been recorded twice.
p238_296|but there's an upturn in the sector.
p238_297|i'm interested in interesting work.
p238_298|they will probably come back.
p238_299|what do we want to do that for ?
p238_300|does the name matter ?
p238_301|how do you get it back ?
p238_302|what are you not good at ?
p238_303|i think therefore i am ?
p238_304|who was she ?
p238_305|motorists will buy passes in advance.
p238_306|no one is predicting a sudden rebound.
p238_307|friday night was a pretty good night.
p238_308|this year it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p238_309|you were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p238_310|we are trying to clarify the issues.
p238_311|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p238_312|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p238_313|movie stars are public property.
p238_314|our message to the monetary policy committee is clear.
p238_315|details of the new vessel were given in london yesterday.
p238_316|that moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p238_317|here the picture is broadly stable.
p238_318|sadly it does not end there.
p238_319|jim has not been a problem for me at all.
p238_320|tell me today and i will make a business decision tomorrow.
p238_321|we believe a third party was involved.
p238_322|and we have the experience.
p238_323|the early physical reports were clear.
p238_324|celtic were the losers then.
p238_325|their conclusions were never published.
p238_326|confidence among the allies began to slip.
p238_327|little is known about them.
p238_328|margins are also in retreat.
p238_329|golf is not like that.
p238_330|it particularly increases under age drinking he claimed.
p238_331|the move follows a review of the singapore
p238_332|which isn't a bad idea.
p238_333|flanker gordon simpson may also feature in that match.
p238_334|they will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
p238_335|he was admitted to hospital.
p238_336|thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p238_337|abbey national is an option.
p238_338|we've had him with us for the past six weeks.
p238_339|harry potter has lost his magic.
p238_340|today we must not repeat that mistake.
p238_341|dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p238_342|he is the son of former chairman lord wolfson.
p238_343|scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
p238_344|this is a sensible and common sense approach.
p238_345|my daughter is an adult.
p238_346|his third goal was superb.
p238_347|i'm very relieved that i have finally won.
p238_349|my father died in childbirth.
p238_350|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p238_351|so did she meet him ?
p238_352|so what is the campaign about ?
p238_353|this measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
p238_354|they're going to open in early summer.
p238_355|anyway the job will be part time.
p238_356|i've been asked that already this morning on the radio.
p238_357|and the world cup has not even begun.
p238_358|he remains a main board director of royal.
p238_359|people should make their own decisions.
p238_360|i saw them last week.
p238_361|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p238_362|it was a good workout.
p238_363|a small number of new jobs will also be created.
p238_364|william hague delighted his party.
p238_365|his background is firmly in venture capital.
p238_366|we played them off the pitch.
p238_368|we can have no complaints.
p238_369|the statement contained no surprises.
p238_370|not that barber has been unhappy.
p238_371|we will likely look for new investors.
p238_372|but the rally was short lived.
p238_373|but you never won any games.
p238_374|it didn't matter who was in their way.
p238_375|and he goes with it.
p238_376|i have little time for analysts.
p238_377|the most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p238_378|it was really quite amazing.
p238_379|it represents a complete change in emphasis.
p238_380|it is the voice of the survivors.
p238_381|it was cynical and callous.
p238_382|he did not say that.
p238_383|so is that it then ?
p238_384|do i have a favourite ?
p238_385|what do we do ?
p238_386|why do it otherwise ?
p238_387|pensions are a long term investment.
p238_388|his successor was only appointed last month.
p238_389|i've had three shots and got nowhere near.
p238_390|it's difficult to put a date on.
p238_391|the amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p238_392|those overseas offices were great.
p238_393|you will have seen the adverts.
p238_394|he was dead on arrival at hospital.
p238_395|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p238_396|subs not used mckenzie ritchie.
p238_397|six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p238_398|standard life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
p238_399|colin is free to speak with other teams.
p238_400|clearly the ira has got away with murder.
p238_401|he left the hospital without receiving any medication.
p238_402|venus rejects the very suggestion.
p238_403|that remains the unanswered question.
p238_404|everything has its place and purpose.
p238_405|civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p238_406|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p238_407|and it had two seats.
p238_408|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p238_409|how are you sir ?
p238_410|but nothing could be done.
p238_411|this is a historic occasion.
p238_412|low pay is endemic in the national health service.
p238_413|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p238_414|defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p238_415|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p238_416|however civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p238_417|this would discourage investment and job creation.
p238_418|we have no information on iraq.
p238_419|either way the investor retains the premium.
p238_420|they prefer the short intensive session.
p238_421|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p238_422|the company declined to comment.
p238_423|it also makes a habit of collecting people.
p238_424|got to get my sunglasses.
p238_425|we decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p238_426|tourism is a vital industry for scotland.
p238_427|it tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p238_428|messages have to be reinforced.
p238_429|not many people like to do that.
p238_430|we accept the new rules.
p238_431|we go there with confidence.
p238_432|it was like the old days.
p238_433|they are interior designers and architects.
p238_434|they can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p238_435|i also had a lot of injuries which did not help me.
p238_436|the only problem was they were on himself.
p238_437|we are aiming for early march.
p238_438|we discovered that for ourselves.
p238_439|it is also very valuable.
p238_440|princess margaret is being buried on that day.
p238_441|none of this work is guaranteed.
p238_442|now we see no mention of rising rates.
p238_443|still some additions are inspired.
p238_444|i believe we can handle this okay.
p238_445|the whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
p238_446|hard cash is needed now.
p238_447|i stayed away from the defence.
p238_448|our performance continues to be outstanding.
p238_449|celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
p238_450|either way it's very funny.
p238_451|it has become a way of life.
p238_452|we didn't want any trouble.
p238_453|it seemed a logical expansion.
p238_454|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p238_455|stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p238_456|now it has doubled in size.
p238_458|i have worked as a stand up there often.
p238_459|they failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p238_460|it is business as usual.
p239_001|please call stella.
p239_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p239_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p239_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p239_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p239_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p239_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p239_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p239_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p239_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p239_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p239_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p239_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p239_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p239_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p239_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p239_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p239_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p239_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p239_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p239_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p239_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p239_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p239_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p239_025|they might have asked for goodness sake.
p239_026|the government however insists the company is not for sale.
p239_027|and so was a photograph.
p239_028|we are not aware of any british casualties at this stage.
p239_029|there isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p239_030|it is about control of our economy.
p239_031|there was a rush of water.
p239_032|that's all i was trying to do today.
p239_033|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p239_034|drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p239_035|i might well have done so already.
p239_036|that can cost him a fortune.
p239_037|he works at the airport.
p239_038|how do you take them away ?
p239_039|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p239_040|after the match do you ?
p239_041|has the conflict started ?
p239_042|have i really come to this ?
p239_043|this matter has still to come before the european parliament.
p239_044|it carried a double message.
p239_045|overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p239_046|but not a penny has been paid.
p239_047|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p239_048|alliance leicester would give it a presence in southern england.
p239_049|we must learn to finish.
p239_050|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p239_051|new york is my home.
p239_052|the head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p239_053|i remember that day well.

p239_055|he is too weak to move.
p239_056|bill clinton always had an idea to sell.
p239_057|i feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
p239_058|among them are many criminals.
p239_059|that's been the difference between the sides.
p239_060|and they removed a borderer.
p239_061|all manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p239_062|perhaps we should do the same.
p239_063|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p239_064|they were on holiday in egypt.
p239_065|they desperately want some stability.
p239_066|everything is possible in football.
p239_067|everyone could see the joke.
p239_068|i'm pleased with the horse.
p239_069|he will need that machine.
p239_070|the new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on tv.
p239_071|then they scored two goals to win.
p239_072|in fact it was geoffrey robinson.
p239_073|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p239_074|the labour party's not downbeat and neither is the labour government.
p239_075|let's not be too despondent.
p239_076|the government does not go far enough.
p239_077|he phoned the number in the brochure.
p239_078|i haven't got there yet.
p239_079|i can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p239_080|they hoped to remain in the edinburgh area.
p239_081|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p239_082|labour has replaced the tories as the party of the family.
p239_083|but the organisers refused to worry.
p239_084|and it had two seats.
p239_085|indeed it is only the beginning.
p239_086|or so the theory goes.
p239_087|he has really done well.
p239_088|so what happens next ?
p239_089|had this been common practice ?
p239_090|what do they want us to do ?
p239_091|is it worth it ?
p239_092|does it matter ?
p239_093|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p239_094|but i had never been in a theatre.
p239_095|it was fun but not a living.
p239_096|kenny miller might come through.
p239_097|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p239_098|the government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p239_099|we will pay their bills.
p239_100|sales are falling after years of growth.
p239_101|it was exactly four months away.
p239_102|but they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
p239_103|we have a major concern about enforcement action.
p239_104|i am so proud of him.
p239_105|this time it might be for real.
p239_106|he will be kept informed.
p239_107|there could be a way back.
p239_108|he was a lovely man.
p239_109|people will have to be patient.
p239_110|i can't remember a lot of it.
p239_111|instead another depression came in.
p239_112|talk of a crisis is absurd.
p239_113|we have thought about doing lots of things.
p239_114|it is sometimes like that.
p239_115|the partners are looking for answers.
p239_116|i've had it for the exams.
p239_117|those people must be accountable.
p239_118|we feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p239_119|the festival is prepared to help.
p239_120|accordingly financial restructuring is required.
p239_121|the error appeared in a warrant.
p239_122|they have now been banned from celtic park for life.
p239_123|basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p239_124|he was just a journalist.
p239_125|they lived for their children.
p239_126|their season has been consigned to history.
p239_127|diversions were put in place.
p239_128|how independent is that ?
p239_129|what form did that take ?
p239_130|are they free ?
p239_131|what are they for ?
p239_132|is there a waiting list ?
p239_133|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p239_134|maybe he has been away from british football for too long.
p239_135|last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p239_136|western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p239_137|gary parker is a favourite of mine.
p239_138|the allegations were still under investigation he added.
p239_139|it is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
p239_140|so it was at easter road.
p239_141|a move to manchester united would be tremendous.
p239_142|absences should be carefully monitored.
p239_143|he is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p239_144|the tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p239_145|we just have to adapt.
p239_146|he was forced to quit.
p239_147|gordon marshall was outstanding against us.
p239_148|people have been placed in a state of alarm.
p239_149|i was given no instructions by no one.
p239_150|the move follows a review of the singapore
p239_151|which isn't a bad idea.
p239_152|since then things have improved.
p239_153|that's what happened against ayr.
p239_154|hopefully no one will suffer too badly.
p239_155|he removed the rubble with the help of passers by.
p239_156|it is a good lifestyle.
p239_157|before the game we went for a pint.
p239_158|our relationship has been very good.
p239_159|it was the climax of the thing.
p239_160|nato has left them with no other option.
p239_161|scottish enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p239_162|i think the referee was good.
p239_163|i understand the medical concerns.
p239_164|scotland will be an integral part of abbey national.
p239_165|this was a unique election.
p239_166|they exist in name alone.
p239_167|we have reacted well to each other.
p239_168|i can see it now.
p239_169|having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p239_170|there's still plenty time left.
p239_171|those three weeks are totally lost.
p239_172|this is a milestone in the modernisation of the scottish prosecution service.
p239_173|she is in good spirits.
p239_174|as if that is an achievement.
p239_175|mr blair should be warned.
p239_176|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p239_177|there was a fossil on screen.
p239_178|is it in the right place ?
p239_179|did he trip ?
p239_180|does that put pressure on us ?
p239_181|did it work ?
p239_182|do you think we are a top nation ?
p239_183|here again they were denied a voice.
p239_184|structural changes were also required.
p239_185|his job was not advertised.
p239_186|that was just one night.
p239_187|this is a frightening development.
p239_188|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p239_189|millions of british jobs depend on europe.
p239_190|sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p239_191|that is an entirely unacceptable position.
p239_192|my father died in childbirth.
p239_193|in addition margins have been maintained.
p239_194|such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
p239_195|the yugoslav army will still be there.
p239_196|two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
p239_197|you've got to be vigilant.
p239_198|he said the director had been completely friendly.
p239_199|tiger is not the norm.
p239_200|it's been a humbling year.
p239_201|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p239_202|marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p239_203|it is all to do with the coaching.
p239_204|there was a fine line to tread.
p239_205|the refund is fully justified.
p239_206|my wife and family are the support system.
p239_207|we are now working with full time on future product.
p239_208|he has many offers from the english premiership.
p239_209|he is a very talented player.
p239_210|bottling is now the core business.
p239_211|i would be surprised if he decided to give up.
p239_212|the protest will go ahead as planned.
p239_213|people have been wonderful beyond belief.
p239_214|the music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p239_215|that group reported just before christmas.
p239_216|we had to add value.
p239_217|their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p239_218|it s all change at kilmarnock.
p239_219|so i got a blood test.
p239_220|russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p239_221|i was caught out a little bit.
p239_222|there's always the next century.
p239_223|the business has expanded rapidly however.
p239_224|but it's an enjoyable job.
p239_225|finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p239_226|there's only one team in ayrshire.
p239_227|initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p239_228|crucially though united were still alive.
p239_229|kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p239_230|she had gone to the catholic school.
p239_231|then we will face the danish champions.
p239_232|it would seem a natural progression.
p239_233|meanwhile the search continues for ferguson's replacement.
p239_234|we will turn the corner.
p239_235|of course it is a tough assignment.
p239_236|my dad is a hero.
p239_237|jackie is passionate about scotland.
p239_238|further details are expected later.
p239_239|this is absolutely not true.
p239_240|they should stop the bombing.
p239_241|these days are long gone.
p239_242|and they were being paid ?
p239_243|was everything done to save people ?
p239_244|what was the matter for concern ?
p239_245|do i think about them often ?
p239_246|not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p239_247|i've learned from my mistakes.
p239_248|adams is surely worth a chance.
p239_249|this season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
p239_250|i've come here for the jersey.
p239_251|the question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p239_252|the strong performance is expected to continue.
p239_253|the challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
p239_254|she replied it could be.
p239_255|allen is strong in every shape and form.
p239_256|her political persuasion is no secret.
p239_257|we have a budget in march.
p239_258|adventure is the champagne of life.
p239_259|we have expanded too quickly.
p239_260|i'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
p239_261|boats and other equipment would be pooled.
p239_262|stewart ivory also declined to comment last night.
p239_263|our position remains the same.
p239_264|the reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p239_265|they could not match it.
p239_266|he is not a pathetic figure.
p239_267|the latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p239_268|they made such decisions in london.
p239_269|this comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p239_270|harrowing is easy after all.
p239_271|each case is treated on merit.
p239_272|a winter of discontent awaits.
p239_273|i thought we were fantastic.
p239_274|they are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p239_275|it's going to be very closely watched.
p239_276|it is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
p239_277|they receive a high profile in the media.
p239_278|our destiny is in our own hands.
p239_279|miller was every bit as happy.
p239_280|even more harrowing though was the reception from her husband and manager.
p239_281|downing street insisted we have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p239_282|there is no internal damage.
p239_283|we've had great things in the past.
p239_284|it could be done by experts and lawyers.
p239_285|it has been recorded twice.
p239_286|aberdeen had little to offer.
p239_287|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p239_288|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p239_289|this youngster is so exciting
p239_290|it was a pre emptive strike.
p239_291|even if they come out playing a physical game we can cope.
p239_292|they will probably come back.
p239_293|this is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
p239_294|i saw them last week.
p239_295|friday night was a pretty good night.
p239_296|this year it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p239_297|you were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p239_298|we may need to take some very radical measures.
p239_299|everyone can have their opinion.
p239_300|the best thing for me was to join the army.
p239_301|celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
p239_302|mr mcleod said he believed a solution would be reached.
p239_303|the early goal was a shock to the system for hearts.
p239_304|that should give me a chance.
p239_305|they have played their part.
p239_306|this will be our new beginning.
p239_307|they have the cash and the fire power.
p239_308|indeed he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p239_309|the company hopes to repeat the process in france.
p239_310|racism has no place in any sport.
p239_311|celtic were the losers then.
p239_312|what do we want to do that for ?
p239_313|does the name matter ?
p239_314|how do you get it back ?
p239_315|what are you not good at ?
p239_316|i think therefore i am ?
p239_317|who was she ?
p239_318|the result is utterly compelling.
p239_319|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p239_320|i have been very nervous.
p239_321|confidence among the allies began to slip.
p239_322|there were also some interesting questions and answers.
p239_323|i won't make an official complaint.
p239_324|it particularly increases under age drinking he claimed.
p239_325|it wasn't about her singing though.
p239_326|they are looking at a flotation.

p240_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.

p240_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p240_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p240_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p240_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p240_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p240_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p240_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p240_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p240_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p240_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p240_018|aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p240_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p240_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p240_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p240_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p240_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p240_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p240_025|johnson was pretty low.
p240_026|but it failed.

p240_029|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p240_030|they should have a major rethink about the event for next year.

p240_095|it seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p240_096|they were outside the circle.

p240_238|it's quite a line up
p240_239|it's very safe.
p240_240|but it's a subtle process.
p240_241|of further privacy he had no need.
p240_242|he was good but not that good.
p240_243|we were extremely poor.
p240_244|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p240_245|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p240_246|it is hard won.
p240_247|a change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p240_248|jock brown is appointed as general manager.
p240_249|i am the opposite because i haven't played very much.
p240_250|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p240_251|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p240_252|he got the same story.
p240_253|it is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p240_254|i have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p240_255|a friendship that will endure.
p240_256|he has already received the freedom of aberdeen.
p240_257|her presence was almost everywhere.
p240_258|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p240_259|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p240_260|blair is very positive at european councils.
p240_261|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p240_262|so in a sense it was a government subsidy.
p240_263|i was happily surprised.
p240_264|they must play for each other.
p240_265|it is also very valuable.
p240_266|george w bush the us president condemned the attacks.
p240_267|blood samples were taken.
p240_268|there is no link.
p240_269|this is a question of islam.
p240_270|it looks as though he will be right.
p240_271|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p240_272|our dispute is with the company not the travelling public.
p240_273|have a look at our accounts.
p240_274|he was also married with two children.
p240_275|and michael was just great.
p240_276|lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p240_277|access has been a nightmare.
p240_278|it has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
p240_279|it's a way of life.
p240_280|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p240_281|a search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p240_282|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p240_283|people have no choice.
p240_284|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p240_285|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p240_286|if not he should go home.
p240_288|his mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
p240_289|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p240_290|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p240_291|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p240_292|he will address the nation this evening.
p240_293|it was a virus.
p240_294|maloney is an engaging talent.
p240_295|the government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p240_296|it's like a high school play.
p240_297|who did the recruiting?
p240_298|he was obviously very genuine.
p240_299|she said she could not believe that they had run away.
p240_300|saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p240_301|a new school will be built.
p240_302|we have to sort it out ourselves.
p240_303|he said she was mad.
p240_304|i was the sheep.
p240_305|there was no hint of scandal.
p240_306|the home was now under new management.
p240_307|the whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p240_308|we are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p240_309|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p240_310|we do not expect any surplus.
p240_311|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p240_312|the plot is minimal.
p240_313|and he goes with it.
p240_314|scotland has shown the way.
p240_315|it is no surprise.
p240_316|let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p240_317|the court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p240_318|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p240_319|they were fantastic.
p240_320|there is no other solution to congestion in edinburgh.
p240_321|we are a peaceful people.
p240_322|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p240_323|henman has been warned.
p240_324|craig is a major concern for us.
p240_325|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p240_326|it is out there.
p240_327|referees are easy targets.
p240_328|they had a confession.
p240_329|we do the same.
p240_330|that's the law of the land.
p240_331|donald was his friend.
p240_332|i am so upset.
p240_333|they also recovered a picture of osama bin laden.
p240_334|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p240_335|the police have to act to help them.
p240_336|we agreed to disagree.
p240_337|it could have gone either way.
p240_338|he was then replaced by ross.
p240_339|i saw some good things.
p240_340|i've not thought about it.
p240_341|who was the mystery mp?
p240_342|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p240_343|it is a sign of hope.
p240_344|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p240_345|three years ago he would have been.
p240_346|locally too the mp is under fire.
p240_347|it is so unfair.
p240_348|they made clear that they are not interested in government assistance.
p240_349|he has to learn.
p240_351|look at the witnesses.
p240_352|that is the very reason why it was so vital.
p240_353|however this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p240_354|the composer will conduct.
p240_355|this is a friendly match?
p240_357|they should take their mobile phones.
p240_358|on the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p240_359|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p240_360|he had played well in that central role.
p240_361|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p240_362|that is a break with tradition.
p240_363|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p240_364|the council said the house would have to be demolished.
p240_365|they say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p240_366|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p240_367|as indeed they would be.
p240_368|but the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p240_369|instead he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p240_370|hartley should know.
p240_371|that would help.
p240_372|a deadline is still essential.
p240_373|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p240_374|mr anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p240_375|we are looking for perfection.
p240_376|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p240_377|he later became a respected high court judge.
p240_378|it's been hard.
p240_379|it's now down in black and white.
p240_380|safety was also an issue.
p241_001|please call stella.
p241_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p241_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p241_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p241_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p241_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p241_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p241_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p241_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p241_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p241_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p241_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p241_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p241_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p241_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p241_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p241_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p241_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p241_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p241_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p241_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p241_025|she is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p241_026|he said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p241_027|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p241_028|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p241_029|however the following year the cancer returned.
p241_030|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p241_031|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p241_032|this is the window.
p241_033|people love to see this stuff.
p241_034|and we have a singer.
p241_035|he took me on a tour of the wards.
p241_036|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p241_037|it's nice to hear.
p241_038|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p241_039|it is not for any other purpose.
p241_040|president bush is at war.
p241_041|it was ugly.
p241_042|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p241_043|that period was a struggle.
p241_044|this represents a tough game for us.
p241_045|we need to chat.
p241_046|that time has passed.
p241_047|as she explains.
p241_048|he is too weak to move.
p241_049|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p241_050|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p241_051|he looks like an afghan.
p241_052|we've got a lot of respect for the lions.
p241_053|however the drama was still not at an end.
p241_055|next league matches celtic.
p241_056|gerhard schroeder was the victor.
p241_057|what was the main difference?
p241_058|i was an athlete.
p241_059|there was a battle there.
p241_061|it was all in a short period of time.
p241_062|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p241_063|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p241_064|the script was funny.
p241_065|he could make it.
p241_066|try to save us.
p241_067|sounds like the sixth sense?
p241_068|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p241_069|i was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p241_070|the company yesterday refused to comment.
p241_071|he highlighted a lack of staff.
p241_072|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p241_073|both sides have been hit by injury.
p241_074|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p241_075|it is a job creation scheme.
p241_076|he is now resident in england.
p241_077|even the one she loved.
p241_078|i've got the shirt.
p241_079|this is the way things should be handled.
p241_080|just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p241_081|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p241_082|i first met him last summer.
p241_083|nothing is yet confirmed.
p241_084|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p241_085|someone who cares
p241_087|global scotland will be held at the glasgow royal concert hall.
p241_088|and rugby fans can help.
p241_089|they have not done so this season so far.
p241_090|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p241_091|now the system is right behind us.
p241_092|today i couldn't run on it.
p241_093|a council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p241_094|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p241_095|that deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p241_096|the peace process will be buried
p241_098|i love the dome.
p241_099|they were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p241_100|it was mayhem.
p241_101|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p241_102|tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on europe.
p241_103|we want to get to the final anyway.
p241_104|they will want to perform well.
p241_105|now though he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p241_106|i'm not depressed.
p241_107|it was his job to check.
p241_108|is that right?
p241_109|you had better believe it.
p241_110|we want to help them through it.
p241_111|it's not a new concept in jazz.
p241_112|the breakdown was much later in her life.
p241_113|it's not fair.
p241_114|we are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p241_115|he will emerge as a world leader.
p241_116|i'm delighted about that.
p241_117|i joined a group.

p241_122|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p241_123|i'm so angry.
p241_124|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p241_125|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p241_126|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p241_127|it's terrible that he has died the same way.
p241_128|buckingham palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p241_129|some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p241_130|the task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p241_132|what will happen then?
p241_133|it's not true.
p241_134|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p241_135|mr hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p241_136|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p241_137|it was typical.
p241_138|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p241_139|if people are genuine then the problem is not osama bin laden.
p241_140|she hopes to study in britain one day.
p241_141|the way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p241_142|he is severe.
p241_143|is that titanic?

p241_151|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p241_152|they were later discharged from hospital.
p241_153|neither side can win this war.
p241_154|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p241_155|was this element always there?
p241_157|it was so new so exciting.
p241_158|but we have not heard a thing from diego.
p241_159|i've put my own money into this project.
p241_160|we do not get that impression now.
p241_161|military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p241_162|we have to move forward.
p241_163|local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p241_164|we have a budget in march.
p241_165|there was no respite.
p241_166|they will do their own thing.
p241_167|the post will be unpaid.
p241_168|waiting times for these services are too long.
p241_169|it is too much for me.
p241_170|he was a crazy man.
p241_171|a helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p241_172|it became a book by itself.
p241_173|one season they might do well.
p241_174|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p241_175|and i saw the light
p241_176|he asked me in a tolerance zone.
p241_177|the clarity is vital.
p241_178|i drove the ball well.
p241_179|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p241_180|they know no other way.
p241_181|it is minute.
p241_182|they will run a mile.

p241_195|it's the same old story.
p241_196|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p241_197|is that success?
p241_198|he has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p241_199|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p241_200|the sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p241_202|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p241_203|he's not perfect.
p241_204|they've got three quarters of the way.
p241_205|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p241_206|we see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p241_207|some realism was needed about time resources and management.
p241_208|i don't want to use it.
p241_209|but i am a worried man.
p241_210|he knows a lot.
p241_211|it had all been arranged.
p241_212|a grampian police spokesman said.

p241_215|we want to keep the pound.
p241_216|i was so nervous.

p241_218|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p241_219|it s the real thing for sure.
p241_220|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p241_221|you have to do your research.
p241_222|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p241_223|we played them off the pitch.
p241_224|but it will be sorted out this week.
p241_225|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p241_226|my neighbours are horrified.
p241_227|the track is currently covered in snow.
p241_228|who would be right?
p241_229|it is set in paris.
p241_230|it is not the message alone.
p241_231|well they were the unlucky ones.
p241_232|hospitals are for the ill.
p241_233|the perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p241_234|we have a free vote on these things in our party.
p241_235|we were extremely poor.
p241_236|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p241_237|we have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p241_238|it is hard won.
p241_239|a change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p241_240|chambers said he would accept the place.
p241_241|manager bobby williamson has no injury worries.
p241_242|in fact we were all over the shop.
p241_243|the scene is about this?
p241_244|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p241_245|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p241_246|they are different types.
p241_247|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p241_248|he has already received the freedom of aberdeen.
p241_249|this is the culture change in medicine.
p241_250|her presence was almost everywhere.
p241_251|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p241_252|special measures were needed.
p241_253|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p241_254|the bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p241_255|it is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p241_256|they are real.
p241_257|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p241_258|their findings are published in the journal injury prevention.
p241_259|that's the only thing i will say.
p241_260|it was good fun.
p241_261|it looks as though he will be right.
p241_262|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p241_264|immediate action must be taken.
p241_265|it's very nice.
p241_266|it left me with a sadness.
p241_267|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p241_268|and michael was just great.
p241_269|lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p241_270|access has been a nightmare.
p241_271|but he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p241_272|a search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p241_273|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p241_274|it was a privilege to work for him.
p241_275|it's so awful.
p241_276|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p241_277|we are a grandmother.
p241_278|we have to break that cycle.
p241_279|i saw it at a ruck.
p241_280|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p241_281|but he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p241_282|yet it worked.
p241_283|i should think so too.
p241_284|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p241_285|the death toll included five children.
p241_286|a tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p241_287|it shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p241_288|it is a vote of confidence in the skills in scotland.
p241_289|it changed my life.
p241_290|a new school will be built.
p241_291|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p241_292|mark fisher was a guest of the northern ireland tourist board.
p241_293|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p241_294|what has altered?
p241_295|however the snow was welcomed by some.
p241_296|it just came into my head that day.
p241_297|our task is to complete the picture.
p241_298|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p241_299|details of the new vessel were given in london yesterday.
p241_300|the whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p241_301|this is a war over our home.
p241_302|it is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p241_303|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p241_304|i was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p241_305|and he goes with it.
p241_306|scotland has shown the way.
p241_307|funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p241_308|the government in westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p241_309|is there on his hands?
p241_310|it was a question of patience.
p241_311|i was rubbish.
p241_312|kids are terrible.
p241_313|it should be equal.
p241_314|craig is a major concern for us.
p241_315|the home team had an amazing start.
p241_317|it is out there.
p241_319|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p241_320|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p241_321|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p241_322|it is a strong case.
p241_323|they also recovered a picture of osama bin laden.
p241_324|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p241_325|i think i was recorded with a video camera.
p241_326|we agreed to disagree.
p241_327|i'd like to take the plunge.
p241_328|my first concern is for the safety of the public.
p241_329|i've not thought about it.
p241_330|who was the mystery mp?
p241_331|it's been hard.
p241_332|they should stop the bombing.
p241_333|who will do it?
p241_334|however sharon rejected the claims.
p241_336|i'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p241_337|i must make that clear.
p241_338|the train was on time.
p241_340|they made clear that they are not interested in government assistance.
p241_342|i would miss him.
p241_343|tiger is the exception.
p241_344|i was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p241_345|i could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p241_346|his contract was then not renewed.
p241_347|i got a yellow card.
p241_349|a report is the first step in a criminal case in india.
p241_350|there is a cup final at stake.
p241_351|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p241_352|the pressure is on celtic in the main.
p241_353|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p241_354|as indeed they would be.
p241_356|it benefits the whole family.
p241_357|our numbers are small.
p241_358|that would help.
p241_359|so i left.
p241_360|we are looking for perfection.
p241_362|this is a club on the rise.
p241_363|equity declined to comment.
p241_364|we have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p241_365|the play is based on a real life event.
p241_366|he could face a jail sentence.
p241_368|he put some colour into scottish history.
p241_369|there was no hint of scandal.
p241_370|safety was also an issue.
p241_371|well the big day has arrived.
p241_372|by that time however it was already too late.
p241_373|talks are progressing.
p241_374|there is no signature.
p243_001|please call stella.
p243_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p243_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p243_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p243_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p243_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p243_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p243_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p243_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p243_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p243_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p243_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p243_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p243_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p243_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p243_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p243_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p243_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p243_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p243_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p243_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p243_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p243_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p243_025|he has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p243_026|his secretary said it was a matter for murray financial to deal with.
p243_027|i've got the same feeling as i had last week in germany.
p243_028|the west coast line is not just for middle england.
p243_029|the budget is a boost for scottish business.
p243_030|she brought a lot to my life.
p243_031|things fall a little flat elsewhere however.
p243_032|thomson and his family left court without comment.
p243_033|i want to give everything to rangers while i am with the club.
p243_034|but the sunday herald said it stood by its story.
p243_035|it is about control of our economy.
p243_036|each brand was owned by a different family.
p243_037|that was not perfect golf by any means.
p243_038|he added that her comments were noted.
p243_039|she will get through it i'm sure.
p243_040|everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p243_041|hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p243_042|he does not even trust his own members.
p243_043|he too started on the subs seats.
p243_044|is it worth it ?
p243_045|does it matter ?
p243_046|how do you take them away ?
p243_047|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p243_048|after the match do you ?
p243_049|has the conflict started ?
p243_050|have i really come to this ?
p243_051|i'm as fit as i can get.
p243_052|we took part in a festival called global dance.
p243_053|he said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p243_054|the important retail business continues to deliver excellent results stewart said.
p243_055|andy was a huge influence yet again.
p243_056|they seem too much of a sure thing.
p243_057|her husband had been waiting for her return.
p243_058|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p243_059|we just want this season to end.
p243_060|it was a day she thought she would never see.
p243_061|talks have continued at many different levels.
p243_062|the referee is there to decide these things.
p243_063|there were no details of the other five victims.
p243_064|it also has a good labour supply.
p243_065|indeed he has a lot of output.
p243_066|do not give your details to anyone.
p243_067|he was failed by his health authority.
p243_068|but it was not all bad news.
p243_069|i cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p243_070|but during the bid process that changed completely.
p243_071|it turned me against the whole system.
p243_072|she seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p243_073|i saw the story but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p243_074|but two groups refused to sign up.
p243_075|i was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p243_076|it had little effect on european equity markets.
p243_077|i'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p243_078|the key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p243_079|the squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p243_080|they said our costs were too high.
p243_081|i do not attempt to answer that.
p243_082|it's been a great evening for us.
p243_083|that kind of growth is the important thing.
p243_084|a regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p243_085|no plan for projects are yet in place.
p243_086|clearly he knows nothing about glasgow or glasgow green.
p243_087|i have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p243_088|celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p243_089|i feel i did not have enough time.
p243_090|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p243_091|i can't remember a lot about the accident.
p243_092|clark was delighted with the effort of jones.
p243_093|they had the appeal of tv stars.
p243_094|there is no issue of national security involved here.
p243_095|he will be a very hard act to follow.
p243_096|earlier both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p243_097|put simply it goes something like this.
p243_098|over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p243_099|even if he doesn't have any lines.
p243_100|i am delighted to hear this news.
p243_101|we are already seeing some positive results.
p243_102|we will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p243_103|we were under a bit of pressure.
p243_104|they won't actually make any money from it.
p243_105|i bought a flat six years ago.
p243_106|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p243_107|they are a different team at home.
p243_108|it took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p243_109|scotland is never far away at westminster.
p243_110|some young girls also came by last night.
p243_111|former hamilton defender colin miller could return to the club today as manager.
p243_112|what are they for ?
p243_113|is there a waiting list ?
p243_114|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p243_115|so what happens next ?
p243_116|had this been common practice ?
p243_117|what do they want us to do ?
p243_118|the idea is the shop within a shop.
p243_119|i left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p243_120|it is the right package for scotland.
p243_121|they have no real friends in the region.
p243_122|england were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p243_123|just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p243_125|i think there's not much between them.
p243_126|so i am going in the right direction.
p243_127|now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p243_128|we have to offer value for money.
p243_129|it's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p243_130|i could live without the attention he admitted.
p243_131|he's got to look after himself now.
p243_132|he said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p243_133|no country has a similar training programme.
p243_134|there is no future in rock music.
p243_135|her research is the second piece by edinburgh university scientists highlighted recently.
p243_136|therefore no one can work full time in these companies.
p243_137|the chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p243_138|we must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p243_139|the programme has been made with great care.
p243_140|there was only one living room you see.
p243_141|i am not under any new pressure.
p243_142|the allegations were still under investigation he added.
p243_143|it appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p243_144|they can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p243_145|all eight victims were based in germany.
p243_146|look george w bush will come here in two months.
p243_147|you should feel involved in their lives.
p243_148|it is open season on the old firm.
p243_149|is it in the right place ?
p243_150|did he trip ?
p243_151|does that put pressure on us ?
p243_152|did it work ?
p243_153|do you think we are a top nation ?
p243_154|three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p243_155|time may already have run out for this option.
p243_156|no contact was made although the arm was clearly raised.
p243_157|when it happened he could hardly believe it.
p243_158|they let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p243_159|as our national coach brown is done for.
p243_160|a progress report will be published in october.
p243_161|this man could yet win over scottish hearts.
p243_162|that will reduce my chance of selection.
p243_163|when germany played there recently the match took place in the new stadium.
p243_164|surely it can't run for two years.
p243_165|but the game is still wide open.
p243_166|it is no good thinking about rangers at this time.
p243_167|however it's possible that dick can influence some dutch players to go there.
p243_168|i knew that i needed to lower my ball flight.
p243_169|we had to work very hard for our points.
p243_170|that is a big risk at any price.
p243_171|you need a long term strategy in football.
p243_172|he said some things which were better left alone.
p243_173|if successful several records will be made.
p243_174|the company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p243_175|it didn't come as any great surprise.
p243_176|finally we decided to put the whole speech in.
p243_177|it's just a different way of life.
p243_178|therefore this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p243_179|nato has left them with no other option.
p243_180|i am secure in my own position.
p243_181|traffic was also heavy around strathclyde park.
p243_182|she is believed to be in south africa.
p243_183|the answer i hope includes the government holyrood and westminster.
p243_184|we have come a long way since then.
p243_185|i made my mind up before we came on tour.
p243_186|a great player has to win major championships.
p243_187|highland health board has a responsibility here.
p243_188|i didn't miss the big house at all.
p243_189|the story was not made public by this club.
p243_190|that capital would be provided equally by the state and established commercial companies.
p243_191|you are not long home from work.
p243_192|i am fighting the force of nature.
p243_193|it involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p243_194|murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p243_195|and they were being paid ?
p243_196|was everything done to save people ?
p243_197|what was the matter for concern ?
p243_198|but they had to be paid for.
p243_199|there was no way back for rangers after that blow.
p243_200|the police insisted that they were standard issue.
p243_201|one in eight workers in edinburgh works for standard life alone.
p243_202|i've never had a year like this.
p243_203|full details are expected to be released in june.
p243_204|as you see with the fuel duty business they do.
p243_205|hague will be leader at the election after next.
p243_206|he is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p243_207|i want an answer from the british government.
p243_208|gas production was also at record levels last year.
p243_209|they are a victim of their own success.
p243_210|we knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p243_211|this is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p243_212|it is going to change the world.
p243_213|scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the scotland manager.
p243_214|people elsewhere in scotland will feel cut off by this.
p243_215|the study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p243_216|i am not going to judge them.
p243_217|i do not see this so much as failure.
p243_218|a european final must be the millennium target.
p243_219|scotland will not vote for new labour next time.
p243_220|i was independent but i am not now.
p243_221|we hope for a fresh board with a fresh clear look at things.
p243_222|we are still seeking that complete performance.
p243_223|my targets for the scottish conservative party are high.
p243_224|someone should force president bush to watch this film.
p243_225|the price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p243_226|if not a deal could take many months.
p243_227|this takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p243_228|royal bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p243_229|i want to see as much progress as possible.
p243_230|this is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p243_231|i felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p243_232|the mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p243_233|they should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p243_234|the labour side has developed in the north area.
p243_235|you are not allowed to do that.
p243_236|that is the last thing they need.
p243_237|he has worked for several years in the united states.
p243_238|the children were later able to leave by bus.
p243_239|jim was down there with his wife.
p243_240|was it the wife ?
p243_241|why change it ?
p243_242|what do we want to do that for ?
p243_243|does the name matter ?
p243_244|how do you get it back ?
p243_245|what are you not good at ?
p243_246|i think therefore i am ?
p243_247|church leaders warned other homes could close.
p243_248|the pair will meet again in glasgow and then train together in australia.
p243_249|my first new year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p243_250|he has many offers from the english premiership.
p243_251|however the figures tell a different story.
p243_252|the rise has come too late for some.
p243_253|rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p243_254|i'd rather play well next week than here.
p243_255|edinburgh prison will also require to be seen.
p243_256|the british government should follow the irish example.
p243_257|commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p243_258|despite his success things began to fall apart.
p243_259|policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p243_260|and they never show the same film as a rival.
p243_261|every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p243_262|there would be a north and south division.
p243_263|the same trend showed up throughout britain.
p243_264|the two companies were not for sale.
p243_265|his condition was described as serious last night.
p243_266|the full cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p243_267|the board do not own the company.
p243_268|last night bush carried it rather easily.
p243_269|they always want to give a performance.
p243_270|its primary business channel is the internet.
p243_271|that's been the difference between the sides.
p243_272|the lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p243_273|i think i was about four years old.
p243_274|meanwhile the trust presented its first grant awards for scotland yesterday.
p243_275|it is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p243_276|despite labour's recent problems it has not been able to do that.
p243_277|i think the shares are good value.
p243_278|one letter from a teacher arrived at christmas.
p243_279|yesterday's session was the last full one before christmas.
p243_280|the life office will now stay with abbey.
p243_281|analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p243_282|overall the last hole was good to the women.
p243_283|he may be ready for first team action in march.
p243_284|the fans pay for their season tickets.
p243_286|in fact i have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p243_287|wall street provided the british market with little fresh direction.
p243_288|no one had seen this sort of thing before.
p243_289|we played well at aberdeen though we lost.
p243_290|he has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p243_291|he would get into any world team.
p243_292|its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p243_293|they first met during a step in london.
p243_294|the agreement remains the only show in town.
p243_295|the question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p243_296|the strong performance is expected to continue.
p243_297|local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p243_298|it is based on population rather than need.
p243_299|he could understand both points of view.
p243_300|so did she meet him ?
p243_301|so what is the campaign about ?
p243_302|and does it ?
p243_303|are you from the rugby ?
p243_304|had i heard ?
p243_305|what happened in that game ?
p243_306|are you going to win ?
p243_308|further heavy charges are expected this year.
p243_309|it happened on average once a week this year.
p243_310|this is the version which appeared in our paper.
p243_311|he is keen to stay in public service.
p243_312|of course people will try the things they see on tv.
p243_313|for that reason cover should not be given.
p243_314|he felt too close to head office.
p243_315|if you believe in the blue and white.
p243_316|a report on their property is due within days.
p243_317|he will just go on doing his job.
p243_318|i always felt they played for me.
p243_319|that's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p243_320|the team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p243_321|this term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p243_322|we will not simply hit these people.
p243_323|we still think this trade is on the increase.
p243_324|it is not either national standards or local control.
p243_325|his name was first linked last year to business for scotland.
p243_326|i feel as if i can hole everything now.
p243_327|i try to be open to experience.
p243_328|he is not exactly a pretty child.
p243_329|i thought the race was a little bit slow.
p243_330|if i didn't go for the world record i'd feel guilty.
p243_331|having a scot play against us would not achieve that.
p243_332|i felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p243_333|these options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p243_334|one royal however was himself criticised yesterday.
p243_335|sports secretary chris smith welcomed the action.
p243_336|i hope numbers will be up on last time.
p243_337|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p243_338|how are you sir ?
p243_339|so is that it then ?
p243_340|do i have a favourite ?
p243_341|put another way they just won't do it.
p243_342|perhaps she met her husband too early she says.
p243_343|getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p243_344|martin o neill called this game almost exactly right.
p243_345|neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p243_346|it was a bit like having children.
p243_347|and the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p243_348|and that is the bottom line box office.
p243_349|i'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p243_350|i think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p243_352|sales will begin by the end of october.
p243_353|the executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p243_354|friday night was a pretty good night.
p243_355|it is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p243_356|the deal is expected to be completed by september.
p243_357|it is the only natural british site on the list.
p243_358|his style was direct and very human.
p243_359|under alex ferguson aberdeen showed it could be done.
p243_360|they have the cash and the fire power.
p243_361|the institute board will take the decision.
p243_362|he's young enough and he must learn.
p243_363|such a policy is for long term strength.
p243_364|both players gave so much to the side.
p243_365|stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p243_366|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p243_367|the dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p243_368|it was a goal which came from nothing.
p243_369|we have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p243_370|i have come here to show support for the families.
p243_371|we have been going for three years.
p243_372|he really played us into a corner.
p243_373|they know the truth they really know the truth.
p243_374|it was another black day for ayrshire.
p243_375|otherwise we might as well hold it now.
p243_376|it used to be all hard sell.
p243_377|the direct effects on trade will be limited.
p243_378|he had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p243_379|he would discuss the peace process in northern ireland.
p243_380|this is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p243_381|this is not a small amount of money.
p243_382|the doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p243_383|i just felt that i was broken down.
p243_384|what do we do ?
p243_385|why do it otherwise ?
p243_386|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p243_387|the cost of this failure will not hit the commission.
p243_388|similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p243_389|he remains a main board director of royal.
p243_390|his record on government has always been highly effective.
p243_391|my tax affairs have been totally open.
p243_392|five years ago its return was rejected.
p243_393|but soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p243_394|in my opinion any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p243_395|in that situation they thought we should be beaten.
p243_396|we are keen to see truth and justice.
p243_397|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p243_398|people have a wish to charge twice.
p244_001|please call stella.
p244_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p244_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p244_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p244_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p244_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p244_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p244_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p244_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p244_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p244_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p244_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p244_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p244_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p244_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p244_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p244_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p244_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p244_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p244_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p244_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p244_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p244_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p244_025|we are a service industry.
p244_026|it may be good for the soul.
p244_027|we want to lift the cup for the fans.
p244_028|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p244_029|it is about investing in the future.
p244_030|however the following year the cancer returned.
p244_031|they were in good humour too.
p244_032|the end result is the same.
p244_033|it is on the internet.
p244_034|these awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p244_035|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p244_036|this is a central issue.
p244_037|history is in the making.
p244_038|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p244_039|she was there for the start of the campaign.
p244_040|she was at the top.
p244_041|in london today it was business as usual.
p244_042|and they had a case.
p244_043|something has to be put in place.
p244_044|if we cannot succeed in this endeavour then so be it.
p244_045|they are going after them.
p244_046|it is all about the story.
p244_047|the whole thing is the music.
p244_048|in fact they are the future of investment.
p244_049|that is still the case.
p244_050|at the moment we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p244_051|in my view it has to be done.
p244_052|the pressure on the players will build.
p244_053|their campaign is in disarray.
p244_054|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p244_055|yesterday he was busy in his office.
p244_056|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p244_057|clearly they had other problems.
p244_058|this trend is likely to strengthen.
p244_059|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p244_060|we have got to deliver.
p244_061|that was the difference today.
p244_062|the company continues to grow.
p244_063|he said it was for sale.
p244_064|we felt it was sufficient.
p244_065|that is all in the past.
p244_066|there is a lot to be done.
p244_067|but that's another story for another day.
p244_068|he has not been dropped.
p244_069|it was an outstanding performance.
p244_070|i can't remember a lot about the accident.
p244_071|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p244_072|it is only the beginning.
p244_073|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p244_074|only water is currently allowed.
p244_075|this time it might be for real.
p244_076|she did that for the rest of her life.
p244_077|seriously we are not concerned at all.
p244_078|that will be the office.
p244_079|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p244_080|how are you sir ?
p244_081|so is that it then ?
p244_082|do i have a favourite ?
p244_083|what do we do ?
p244_084|why do it otherwise ?
p244_085|it starts with the script.
p244_086|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p244_087|it would have been around the turn of the century.
p244_088|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p244_089|thankfully mr campbell was able to help.
p244_090|it seems a good thing to try.
p244_091|however he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p244_092|it sounds a lot of money.
p244_093|however a ruling will not come before next week.
p244_094|it is not a story.
p244_095|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p244_096|he is in the us.
p244_097|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p244_098|it took an option on the process.
p244_099|by then he was walking on water.
p244_100|this is a game of confidence.
p244_101|on saturday it was much the same.
p244_102|he liked the weather the courses the food.
p244_103|the door is still open but we need a bit of help.
p244_104|the trick is to try it.
p244_105|i had no intention of misleading anyone.
p244_106|victory was never in doubt.
p244_107|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p244_108|on this occasion the case for a public inquiry was not made.
p244_109|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p244_110|then again we could have.
p244_111|there you were just a body.
p244_112|but he has not become a monster.
p244_113|he is not a dancer.
p244_114|we had planned to sell the property for some time.
p244_115|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p244_116|in the end we have to take a stand.
p244_117|this is a sea change in approach.
p244_118|otherwise the market may come back.
p244_119|the procedures were not in place.
p244_120|for these people the ruling is very welcome.
p244_121|in the end we did not spend a penny on him.
p244_122|he was not alone at the top of the board.
p244_123|the announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p244_124|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p244_125|we had a great time.
p244_126|i am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
p244_127|according to criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p244_128|it was far from business as usual.
p244_129|he wanted to record the group.
p244_130|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p244_131|naturally it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p244_132|it is hard to believe.
p244_133|or it would have been.
p244_134|three days later he was killed.
p244_135|football is a passion for many.
p244_136|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p244_137|so did she meet him ?
p244_138|so what is the campaign about ?
p244_139|and does it ?
p244_140|are you from the rugby ?
p244_141|however the bank denied that he was in the running.
p244_142|that was the first step.
p244_143|however the city was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p244_144|i have been in contact with him.
p244_145|actors like to be in the centre.
p244_146|when we played them last year we were beaten by the weather.
p244_147|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p244_148|i am the manager of scotland.
p244_149|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p244_150|there were no grounds for his action.
p244_151|i can't even get into the a team.
p244_152|it starts at the top.
p244_153|others are expected to follow the lead.
p244_154|she does not want to speak.
p244_155|it was all for good reason as well.
p244_156|one letter from a teacher arrived at christmas.
p244_157|it is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p244_158|as for the warning it was not needed.
p244_159|if not a deal could take many months.
p244_160|we want to get there.
p244_161|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p244_162|there is a lack of staff.
p244_163|not that the occasion was without restraint.
p244_164|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p244_165|this would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p244_166|at last in the third year a letter has arrived.
p244_167|full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p244_168|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p244_169|anyone can do the sums.
p244_170|we have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
p244_171|it is not about the money it is about everything.
p244_172|details will be published in the herald in the coming weeks.
p244_173|we were all over the place in the first half.
p244_174|like the others he was arrested.
p244_175|all the pressure was on him.
p244_176|charles gordon leader of glasgow city council declined to comment.
p244_177|they have not been named.
p244_178|it sounds like an appalling tragic incident.
p244_179|i think the labour party is completely split on this.
p244_180|it is ambitious but it can be achieved.
p244_181|i was always in control.
p244_182|it was by the numbers.
p244_183|i would like to see the figures for the second quarter.
p244_184|it should never have happened.
p244_185|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p244_186|the feeling is hard to describe.
p244_187|it is difficult to say.
p244_188|that is a question for the next manager.
p244_189|by then however both men were already in the us.
p244_190|however he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p244_191|it is simply not true.
p244_192|are you going to win ?
p244_193|was it the wife ?
p244_194|why change it ?
p244_195|what do we want to do that for ?
p244_196|does the name matter ?
p244_197|that you can do it.
p244_198|i would like to continue to develop.
p244_199|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p244_200|he has defended the system.
p244_201|we want to begin a programme in the uk.
p244_203|at the top level the salaries are far too high.
p244_204|it is not an issue.
p244_205|they have to get that sorted.
p244_206|we can take the city.
p244_207|he played it like a veteran.
p244_208|it was the story of the second half.
p244_209|many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p244_210|as many as the market will support.
p244_211|he is believed to live in britain.
p244_212|hopefully it will bring new customers.
p244_213|the report was welcomed by the law society of scotland.
p244_214|this conference was never confirmed.
p244_215|a team is a team.
p244_216|however murray johnstone is not on the menu.
p244_217|i'm interested in interesting work.
p244_218|it decided to blame the media.
p244_219|the force is with them.
p244_220|this year it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p244_221|it was important to win today.
p244_222|he was not injured in the attack.
p244_223|because he was born in england.
p244_224|indeed he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p244_225|milk producers were in need of immediate assistance he said.
p244_226|i was not overly concerned about this.
p244_227|however it is not as simple as this.
p244_228|we want this place to work.
p244_229|it still has an effect.
p244_230|the tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p244_231|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p244_232|other villages were completely deserted.
p244_233|there is a lot of concern.
p244_234|it will be decided in the next month.
p244_235|we have to win the group.
p244_236|it seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p244_237|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p244_238|we have an election in eight days.
p244_239|there was a lot of resentment.
p244_240|this is a fight to the death.
p244_241|all will be revealed in due course.
p244_242|he is a man of the people.
p244_243|the matter is under appeal.
p244_244|and they were being paid ?
p244_245|was everything done to save people ?
p244_246|what was the matter for concern ?
p244_247|do i think about them often ?
p244_248|is it in the right place ?
p244_249|did he trip ?
p244_250|sadly it could not be done.
p244_251|i wouldn't even respond to that question.
p244_252|investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p244_253|instead he missed the lot.
p244_254|i was never in danger.
p244_255|a lot has been written.
p244_256|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p244_257|it was really good in the first week.
p244_258|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p244_259|however the ball refused to sit for the frenchman.
p244_260|that is not the case in europe.
p244_261|but it was a loss.
p244_262|so far the problems have occurred in the us.
p244_263|the performance continues to improve.
p244_264|it expected this trend to continue.
p244_265|however no further action was taken by police.
p244_266|it depends on labour not on us.
p244_267|but we were in control at that point.
p244_268|it has to be enforced.
p244_269|the party has never fully recovered.
p244_270|moreover it must be for all sports.
p244_271|but the government has so far failed to listen.
p244_272|he must have a crack at it.
p244_273|i am still waiting for a reply.
p244_274|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p244_275|he was good but not that good.
p244_276|the company still had the confidence of its bankers he said.
p244_277|mr crawford is no stranger to scottish enterprise.
p244_278|however the matter is not going to end there.
p244_279|it might be sad but it's a fact.
p244_280|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p244_281|obviously we would want to look at this.
p244_282|on a practical level it would be difficult.
p244_283|if so it is a funny time to introduce it.
p244_284|it is important that he is involved.
p244_285|if he saw somebody in trouble he would try to help.
p244_286|it should be noted that he has been released without charge.
p244_287|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p244_288|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p244_290|i should think so too.
p244_291|none of the agencies was able to help.
p244_292|i didn't see the point.
p244_293|this idea has been around for four years.
p244_294|we are in a war.
p244_295|do you think we are a top nation ?
p244_296|is our children learning ?
p244_297|how independent is that ?
p244_298|what form did that take ?
p244_299|are they free ?
p244_300|scotland won by six wickets.
p244_301|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p244_302|this is a historic agreement.
p244_303|we have to be realistic.
p244_304|every one is a winner.
p244_305|there was a hole in it.
p244_306|it will be done in stages.
p244_307|it all started with a visiting rugby club.
p244_308|every character was completely different.
p244_309|but it is a similar problem.
p244_310|in the uk inflation data will be published this morning.
p244_311|but it is important for a number of reasons.
p244_312|in that moment i was happy.
p244_313|all of the management has invested in the firm.
p244_314|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p244_315|they were not at the property yesterday.
p244_316|it involved the same people.
p244_317|we want to get back into the champions league.
p244_318|we have to be very very careful.
p244_319|look at the potential of this club.
p244_320|hopefully this week will be good.
p244_321|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p244_322|we did something about it.
p244_323|but it is up again.
p244_324|however the devil is in the detail.
p244_325|for the moment however the position is clear.
p244_326|the suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p244_327|he is already in place.
p244_328|another difference is the cost.
p244_329|overall we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p244_330|and we can do it.
p244_331|what are they for ?
p244_333|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p244_334|tax is a matter for national governments.
p244_335|and it's a goodbye from him.
p244_336|it is a sensitive issue.
p244_337|they have to be addressed.
p244_338|this isn't a betrayal of public services it's their renewal.
p244_339|like many companies it is a problem.
p244_340|the business is mainly active in europe the us and australia.
p244_341|however a bid was never made.
p244_342|that is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p244_343|something is going to have to give.
p244_344|and the context is also completely different.
p244_345|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p244_346|the banking sector was weak.
p244_347|but the new year was special.
p244_348|we never played at all.
p244_349|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p244_350|this isn't the end of story.
p244_351|he is a great prospect.
p244_352|he has been told by the doctor to rest.
p244_353|however walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p244_354|of course it does not have to be this way.
p244_355|this latter suggestion is very important.
p244_356|however it does not tell the full story.
p244_357|they were impressive against france.
p244_358|the challenge is to win a cup.
p244_359|hopefully he will get a lucky break.
p244_360|it was a test in itself.
p244_361|either team will be hard.
p244_362|the parents will have a great time too.
p244_363|at first the youngster was not keen.
p244_364|however it has to be seen as part of a package.
p244_365|on thursday mr blair will address the institute of public policy research.
p244_366|in fact it was almost as if it was expected.
p244_367|lately that market has come under pressure.
p244_368|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p244_369|however it was well worth the wait.
p244_370|the commitment was not long and it was worth the risk.
p244_371|i have a good feeling about this.
p244_372|the news is not all bad.
p244_373|some of the passing was a disgrace.
p244_374|however it does not seem to be the case.
p244_375|it is almost certain to be the last.
p244_376|you have to be patient.
p244_377|however the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p244_378|i was delighted to accept.
p244_379|a few days after making the video i went to the inquiry.
p244_380|we are not going to fight in kosovo.
p244_381|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p244_382|it's fantastic to win again.
p244_383|for businesses the benefits will be enormous.
p244_384|the company won the first round but lost on appeal.
p244_385|everything is in the mix.
p244_386|an announcement is expected this week.
p244_387|he will be difficult to replace.
p244_388|i would be interested in another attempt.
p244_389|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p244_390|he was on a mission.
p244_391|does it matter ?
p244_392|how do you take them away ?
p244_393|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p244_394|after the match do you ?
p244_395|one third of the places are already taken.
p244_396|i understand the frustration of the fans.
p244_397|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p244_398|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p244_399|i want this one to be different.
p244_400|it is the last meeting of the season.
p244_401|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p244_402|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p244_403|he is a quality player.
p244_404|the service is expected to be introduced in december.
p244_405|it's all been about the basics of the business.
p244_406|there is a demand for it.
p244_407|it's great that it happened in britain.
p244_408|i tried to be cautious but it's hard in that role.
p244_409|they are not going the length of the pitch.
p244_410|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p244_411|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p244_412|thankfully peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p244_413|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p244_414|in order to get there we have got to invest.
p244_415|overall the labour market continued to tighten.
p244_416|there is no need to panic.
p244_417|it had been on the cards.
p244_418|however he said the proposal was at an early stage.
p244_419|building an underground for example has proved a nightmare.
p244_420|that might mean another delay.
p244_421|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p244_422|i am delighted for them.
p244_423|he's had to suffer for the last six years.
p244_424|but it was a struggle.
p245_001|please call stella.
p245_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p245_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p245_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p245_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p245_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p245_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p245_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p245_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p245_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p245_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p245_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p245_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p245_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p245_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p245_016|norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p245_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p245_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p245_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p245_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p245_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p245_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p245_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p245_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p245_025|johnson was pretty low.
p245_026|but it failed.
p245_027|it's nice to hear.
p245_028|we decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p245_029|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p245_030|they should be so lucky.
p245_031|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p245_032|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p245_033|i was an athlete.
p245_034|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p245_035|so if we can take anything from tonight it will be fantastic.
p245_036|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p245_037|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p245_038|it has failed.
p245_039|it was clear.
p245_040|it's a great thing.
p245_041|indeed he does.
p245_042|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p245_043|she is believed to be in south africa.
p245_044|but it took a lot of bottle.
p245_045|sure it's funny.
p245_046|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p245_047|this represents a tough game for us.
p245_048|we need to chat.
p245_049|the boy is no longer with us.
p245_050|who can say?
p245_051|it's a blessing.
p245_053|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p245_054|they had to explain it.
p245_055|he had no enemies.
p245_056|sadly it can't.
p245_057|none has ever been found.
p245_058|it's a matter of balance.
p245_059|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p245_060|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p245_061|hopefully we have learned a lot from that game.
p245_062|he should have asked for a second opinion.
p245_063|he was popular.
p245_064|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p245_065|the script was funny.
p245_066|you need a trademark.
p245_067|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p245_068|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p245_069|she died in hospital two hours later.
p245_070|is there a new way forward?
p245_071|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p245_072|people must remain vigilant.
p245_073|this is the way things should be handled.
p245_074|every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p245_075|what has changed?
p245_076|i'd like to continue that record.
p245_077|that is bound to happen.
p245_078|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p245_079|we have other options.
p245_080|the album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p245_081|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p245_082|it's never too late.
p245_083|global scotland will be held at the glasgow royal concert hall.
p245_084|now the system is right behind us.
p245_085|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p245_086|it is a lifeline.
p245_087|the reason is to do with the nature of the scotland manager.
p245_088|then came the crunch.
p245_089|if you could find it.
p245_090|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p245_091|they were outside the circle.
p245_092|he's a star.
p245_093|it was some time before she found out he was safe.
p245_094|we want to get to the final anyway.
p245_095|oil embargo endorsed.
p245_096|no date has been set for the appeal.
p245_097|it was an adventure.
p245_098|now though he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p245_099|they had to be cut from the wreckage.
p245_100|i was angry.
p245_101|that team is due to be announced this morning.
p245_102|i have had no social life at all.
p245_103|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p245_104|i'm delighted about that.
p245_105|we felt at the moment it was not possible.
p245_106|who would be a referee?
p245_107|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p245_108|who would have?
p245_109|the whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p245_110|we work on the same level.
p245_111|i can't even get into the a team.
p245_112|wednesday night was a difficult time for britton.
p245_113|next season for every manager is a long time away.
p245_114|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p245_115|buckingham palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p245_116|i do not think this family will ever get over this.
p245_117|wish i could be there on sunday in person but i can't.
p245_118|he has been under great pressure.
p245_119|who will attend?
p245_120|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p245_121|the trial is funded solely by edinburgh city council.
p245_122|what will happen then?
p245_123|is that it?
p245_124|he was in a great deal of pain.
p245_125|we want to keep the pound.
p245_126|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p245_127|there is a lack of chemistry.
p245_128|i was awful.
p245_129|that group reported just before christmas.
p245_130|it is not just about pay.
p245_131|he will emerge as a world leader.
p245_132|they did very well.
p245_133|it's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p245_134|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p245_135|the woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p245_136|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p245_137|last night he was due to hold talks with arafat.
p245_138|mr blair had done well.
p245_139|it's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p245_140|the weather affected the other two games in fife.
p245_141|he can do no wrong.
p245_142|was this element always there?
p245_143|i've learned from my mistakes.
p245_144|a labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p245_145|it has to be now.
p245_146|i was in the train station overnight.
p245_147|the release attracted little attention.
p245_148|that will do for me.
p245_149|nobody did in those days.
p245_150|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p245_151|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p245_152|it became a book by itself.
p245_154|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p245_155|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p245_156|the hotel was now for sale.
p245_157|i drove the ball well.
p245_158|everyone can be bought.
p245_160|we've got a lot of respect for the lions.
p245_161|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p245_162|they will run a mile.
p245_163|we did everything by the book.
p245_164|it is not fair.
p245_165|what has caused the demise of singing?
p245_166|i had a train to catch.
p245_167|it was an odd affair in many respects.
p245_168|it is tough but possible.
p245_170|the procedure is the same in all cases.
p245_171|people will ask about us.
p245_172|i think the commission has been very very slow to react.
p245_173|we must keep our feet on the ground.
p245_174|however he said the money had not been wasted.
p245_175|mr kennedy is not a candidate for the scottish parliament.
p245_176|details of the new vessel were given in london yesterday.
p245_177|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p245_178|it was still there but right at the end.
p245_179|the conference is the first test.
p245_180|is that success?
p245_181|but we are not immune to the problem.
p245_182|the red card was okay.
p245_183|i have a cold.
p245_184|they are in the euro.
p245_185|he's not perfect.
p245_186|the tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p245_187|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p245_188|it's all about money money money.
p245_189|that will be vital.
p245_190|now it's all right.
p245_191|it's like a garage.
p245_192|we don't even know his name.
p245_193|feel the heat?
p245_194|he knows a lot.
p245_195|i began to pray.
p245_196|i had decided to quit the show.
p245_197|his third goal was superb.
p245_198|it's been a good year.
p245_199|the second is the reaction of the hibs fans.
p245_200|so far the scheme has not been used in scotland.
p245_201|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p245_202|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p245_203|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p245_204|friends of the earth scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p245_205|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p245_206|but we have not heard a thing from diego.
p245_207|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p245_208|he demanded to speak to the boss.
p245_209|you have to do your research.
p245_210|saturday is gone.
p245_211|the loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p245_212|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p245_213|it was good fun.
p245_214|at the time he was a living legend.
p245_215|it's so special.
p245_216|you should always be able to get out in some direction.
p245_217|i can't wait to meet him.
p245_218|my wife and family are the support system.
p245_219|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p245_220|they had no children.
p245_221|we are in the hat.
p245_222|we were a load of rubbish.
p245_223|they should come forward.
p245_224|it is not the message alone.
p245_225|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p245_226|it's quite a line up
p245_227|i might get an injury very easily.
p245_228|this fact is supported by audience research.
p245_229|he was good but not that good.
p245_230|the problem in norway is outside the national.
p245_231|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p245_232|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p245_233|it would appear that it has not been a problem.
p245_234|it's only fair.
p245_235|he says that he is no different from any other man.
p245_236|you can feel at home in china.
p245_237|we did not compete with any other local farmer.
p245_238|it is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p245_239|there wasn't a goal.
p245_240|i was shocked.
p245_241|they are different types.
p245_242|it was a hit.
p245_243|i didn't need to watch it on the video.
p245_244|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p245_245|this year i understood.
p245_246|her presence was almost everywhere.
p245_247|they need to look after themselves.
p245_248|is there on his hands?
p245_249|i can't get a job.
p245_250|it is nearly there.
p245_251|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p245_252|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p245_253|it's that kind of place.
p245_254|they fail to engage.
p245_256|i was happily surprised.
p245_257|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p245_258|i would have the hammer in the crowd.
p245_259|i have a dream.
p245_260|it is set in paris.
p245_261|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p245_262|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p245_263|immediate action must be taken.
p245_264|it left me with a sadness.
p245_265|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p245_266|we do not want any terrorist attacks on any israeli civilians.
p245_267|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p245_268|of course i was tempted.
p245_269|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p245_270|people have no choice.
p245_271|she looked so young.
p245_272|it happens from time to time.
p245_273|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p245_274|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p245_275|you've got to have both sides.
p245_276|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p245_277|it was a virus.
p245_278|yet it worked.
p245_279|it's very safe.
p245_280|well he can do it.
p245_281|he was obviously very genuine.
p245_282|it goes back a long way.
p245_283|the weather forecast isn't good.
p245_284|it is a vote of confidence in the skills in scotland.
p245_285|he added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p245_286|but it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p245_287|that could change.
p245_288|the goals will come.
p245_289|sunday's game was not a trial.
p245_290|this is a huge confidence boost.
p245_291|we have to sort it out ourselves.
p245_292|he has retired.
p245_293|there was no hint of scandal.
p245_294|i thought it was my only chance.
p245_295|nothing is safe.
p245_296|they are wrong.
p245_297|the confidence is low but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p245_298|the whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p245_299|we are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p245_300|it's just not funny
p245_301|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p245_302|and he goes with it.
p245_303|you are the glory.
p245_304|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p245_305|we want to play at the worlds.
p245_306|we have waited a long time for this.
p245_307|he was solid.
p245_308|this is the culture change in medicine.
p245_309|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p245_310|it also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
p245_311|i never thought it would take this long.
p245_312|they wanted the club to make money.
p245_313|craig is a major concern for us.
p245_314|for the moment our position remains the same.
p245_315|they had a confession.
p245_316|i am very happy to be here.
p245_317|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p245_318|there was no time scale.
p245_319|my view has now completely changed.
p245_320|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p245_321|it was no secret that i wanted to sign him.
p245_322|the boat was fantastic.
p245_323|i saw some good things.
p245_324|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p245_325|you can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p245_326|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p245_327|work is under way to create a studio in inverness.
p245_328|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p245_329|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p245_330|who will do it?
p245_331|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p245_332|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p245_333|i'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p245_334|i reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p245_335|the train was on time.
p245_336|action is needed now.
p245_337|but the disease has not been confined to the tory party.
p245_338|indeed it was magical.
p245_339|i would miss him.
p245_340|there's no place to hide.
p245_341|sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p245_342|i'm very lucky.
p245_343|it was forced to divert.
p245_344|chambers said he would accept the place.
p245_345|he was then replaced by ross.
p245_346|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p245_347|like his acting it was an accident.
p245_348|they should take their mobile phones.
p245_349|it is not like working for a living.
p245_350|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p245_351|a report is the first step in a criminal case in india.
p245_352|the parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p245_353|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p245_354|it was very formal.
p245_355|the pressure is on celtic in the main.
p245_356|it's not that clear cut.
p245_357|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p245_358|he's very explosive.
p245_359|but nothing happened.
p246_001|please call stella.
p246_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p246_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p246_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p246_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p246_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p246_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p246_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p246_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p246_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p246_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p246_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p246_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p246_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p246_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p246_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p246_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p246_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p246_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p246_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p246_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p246_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p246_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p246_025|he has not been named.
p246_026|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p246_027|is this accurate?
p246_028|however the following year the cancer returned.
p246_029|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p246_030|there's a story too.
p246_031|this is the window.
p246_032|he was jailed for five years.
p246_033|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p246_034|then suddenly they weren't.
p246_035|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p246_036|it has failed.
p246_037|they're just different.
p246_038|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p246_039|indeed he does.
p246_040|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p246_041|the ambition this year is to improve on last.
p246_042|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p246_043|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p246_044|we will push.
p246_045|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p246_046|they said she was stable.
p246_047|is a drug dealer?
p246_048|there is no reason at all.
p246_049|the state would provide.
p246_050|she looked so young.
p246_051|every aspect of our play was first class.
p246_052|here's a clue.
p246_053|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p246_054|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p246_055|it is unique.
p246_056|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p246_057|that's the truth.
p246_058|i feel i did not have enough time.
p246_059|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p246_060|scotland had great assets.
p246_061|it's that kind of place.
p246_062|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p246_063|he could make it.
p246_064|sounds like the sixth sense?
p246_065|robin williams is very subdued.
p246_066|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p246_067|there could be a way back.
p246_068|then followed a bout of flu.
p246_069|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p246_070|it is a job creation scheme.
p246_071|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p246_072|even the one she loved.
p246_073|people must remain vigilant.
p246_074|today she has been released.
p246_075|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p246_076|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p246_077|he is in the queue.
p246_078|i first met him last summer.
p246_079|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p246_080|a play is a set of actions.
p246_081|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p246_082|it is a blow.
p246_083|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p246_084|they lived for their children.
p246_085|it will be tight.
p246_086|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p246_087|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p246_088|tony blair said as little.
p246_089|as indeed they would be.
p246_090|this one did.
p246_091|it was clear.
p246_092|but i was wrong.
p246_093|it is home grown.
p246_094|i saw the whole thing.
p246_095|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p246_096|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p246_097|they make a selective perception process.
p246_098|meanwhile the scottish consumer council yesterday offered support for the new bill.
p246_099|no the equipment is extra.
p246_100|that would be unlawful.
p246_101|oil embargo endorsed.
p246_102|but they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p246_103|before the game we went for a pint.
p246_104|it was an adventure.
p246_105|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p246_106|i was fighting for my life i thought.
p246_107|is that right?
p246_108|i had some time with aston villa.
p246_109|it was the eighties.
p246_110|it is so sad.
p246_111|it would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p246_112|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p246_113|who would be a referee?
p246_114|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p246_115|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p246_116|who would have?
p246_117|here again they were denied a voice.
p246_118|there were no grounds for his action.
p246_119|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p246_120|she really suffered for her art.
p246_121|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p246_122|it is not a u turn.
p246_123|i just wanted a break.
p246_124|twaddle is a case in point.
p246_125|i am now unemployed.
p246_126|she said she would not welcome the flowers.
p246_127|it plans to return to this field.
p246_128|it's perfectly feasible.
p246_129|we work well together.
p246_130|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p246_131|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p246_132|we are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p246_133|my daughter is an adult.
p246_134|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p246_135|it seems so long since i did the exams.
p246_136|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p246_137|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p246_138|no one in downing street can speak the language of the unions.
p246_139|she died at her home.
p246_140|he realises his mistake.
p246_141|he felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p246_142|i was awful.
p246_143|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p246_144|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p246_145|he sets the nature of his parliament in a simple realistic context.
p246_146|it is not just about pay.
p246_147|i am just trying to do my job.
p246_148|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p246_149|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p246_150|i was stunned.
p246_151|but he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p246_152|the woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p246_153|the departure of mr johnston was reported by the herald yesterday.
p246_154|she had gone to the catholic school.
p246_155|we are on a four year mission.
p246_156|she also defended the lord chancellor's existing powers.
p246_157|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p246_158|i'd love to be like peter.
p246_159|i will tell you.
p246_160|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p246_161|it is not like us.
p246_162|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p246_163|we have a budget in march.
p246_164|again we were lucky.
p246_165|we should do everything at a stroke.
p246_166|you had to go and see him.
p246_167|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p246_168|he was a crazy man.
p246_169|as we worked.
p246_170|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p246_171|it is not either national standards or local control.
p246_172|if that's the case he will struggle.
p246_173|i drove the ball well.
p246_174|tony had arrived.
p246_175|the conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p246_176|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p246_177|the goals were good.
p246_178|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p246_179|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p246_180|they need to look after themselves.
p246_181|it's to do with context.
p246_182|does this matter?
p246_183|one was a lawyer.
p246_184|there is no openness.
p246_185|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p246_186|i think the commission has been very very slow to react.
p246_187|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p246_188|it was very frightened and dirty.
p246_189|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p246_190|the concerns are the same.
p246_191|is that success?
p246_192|i do not own the vessel in question.
p246_193|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p246_194|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p246_195|who will pay for this?
p246_196|they've got three quarters of the way.
p246_197|the album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p246_198|it's all about money money money.
p246_199|some realism was needed about time resources and management.
p246_200|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p246_201|i will win.
p246_202|feel the heat?
p246_203|he knows a lot.
p246_204|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p246_205|it had all been arranged.
p246_206|i have decided to quit the show.
p246_207|my neighbours are horrified.
p246_208|it's not ideal.
p246_209|in each case they were a goal down.
p246_210|i have wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p246_211|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p246_212|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p246_213|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p246_214|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p246_215|the report is due out next month.
p246_216|because they didn't want to know.
p246_217|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p246_218|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p246_219|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p246_220|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p246_221|i'd never seen a play about me.
p246_222|it's not before time.
p246_223|i didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p246_224|he said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p246_225|but she was.
p246_226|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p246_227|at the time he was a living legend.
p246_228|my wife and family are the support system.
p246_229|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p246_230|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p246_231|but you think i'm going to argue with the big man?
p246_232|of course i was tempted.
p246_233|well they were the unlucky ones.
p246_234|you should be.
p246_235|it's quite nice.
p246_236|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p246_237|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p246_238|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p246_239|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p246_240|it is hard won.
p246_241|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p246_242|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p246_243|the scene is about this?
p246_244|we will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p246_245|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p246_246|i should think so too.
p246_247|it was a hit.
p246_248|there's the mix.
p246_249|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p246_250|is there on his hands?
p246_251|i can't get a job.
p246_252|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p246_253|they fail to engage.
p246_254|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p246_255|is that a serious question?
p246_256|they must play for each other.
p246_257|i could have got out a long time ago.
p246_258|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p246_259|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p246_260|there's not much money in cycling.
p246_261|souter will be back.
p246_262|blood samples were taken.
p246_263|they want to shut the scottish office.
p246_264|it will be done in stages.
p246_265|there is no link.
p246_266|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p246_267|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p246_268|we are happy.
p246_270|we're in shock.
p246_271|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p246_272|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p246_273|it's a way of life.
p246_274|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p246_275|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p246_276|he promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p246_277|they seem to get away with it.
p246_278|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p246_279|it is so very obvious.
p246_280|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p246_281|it's so awful.
p246_282|if not he should go home.
p246_283|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p246_284|we are a grandmother.
p246_285|but i've won both ways.
p246_286|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p246_287|you feel very helpless.
p246_288|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p246_289|dialogue is the key.
p246_290|he will address the nation this evening.
p246_291|it was a virus.
p246_292|yet it worked.
p246_293|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p246_294|it was good.
p246_295|bombing slaughter rejected
p246_296|we are not going to forget.
p246_297|no briton has ever won.
p246_298|and huge indeed it is.
p246_299|mark fisher was a guest of the northern ireland tourist board.
p246_300|he was at home with his pals.
p246_301|what has altered?
p246_302|she is really magic.
p246_303|the award to senator mitchell was announced by the foreign office.
p246_304|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p246_305|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p246_306|we could easily be cut again.
p246_307|the plot is minimal.
p246_308|you are the glory.
p246_309|the minister is the engineer.
p246_310|the letters are going out today.
p246_311|i'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p246_312|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p246_313|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p246_314|she is on a life support machine.
p246_315|we are a peaceful people.
p246_316|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p246_318|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p246_319|they had a confession.
p246_320|i came into this world with nothing.
p246_321|it's too horrible to think.
p246_322|off with their heads.
p246_323|there was no time scale.
p246_324|either team will be hard.
p246_325|it shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p246_326|he scored a touchdown.
p246_327|is that an issue?
p246_328|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p246_329|who will do it?
p246_330|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p246_331|locally too the mp is under fire.
p246_332|this is the last straw.
p246_333|two people were interviewed.
p246_334|i've got no secret.
p246_335|he loved the moment.
p246_336|i'm very lucky.
p246_337|our policy is clear.
p246_338|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p246_339|yet for my money he was not the man of the match.
p246_340|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p246_341|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p246_342|they should take their mobile phones.
p246_343|i got a yellow card.
p246_344|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p246_345|he had taken everything from me.
p246_346|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p246_347|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p246_348|until they came to do it.
p246_349|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p246_350|the pair are very much in love.
p246_351|i was in the train station overnight.
p246_352|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p246_353|hartley should know.
p246_354|that would help.
p246_355|it is a memorial.
p246_357|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.

p247_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p247_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p247_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p247_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p247_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p247_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p247_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p247_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p247_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p247_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p247_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p247_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p247_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p247_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p247_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p247_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p247_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p247_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.

p247_422|the projections are very positive for south africa.
p247_423|that's been all around europe with me.
p247_424|surrey police said no body had been found.
p247_425|it was submitted without their knowledge.
p247_426|being captain of this club is fantastic.
p247_427|my aim is a top six finish.
p247_428|a similar scheme is under way in central scotland.
p247_429|such an attack is bizarre.
p247_430|the success of the open eye has enabled the business to expand.
p247_431|no date has been fixed for his return.
p247_432|it was a breathtaking moment.
p247_433|last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p247_434|no one wanted to run it tonight.
p247_435|it's going to be epic.
p247_436|there is another important factor.
p247_437|we've made a couple of albums.
p247_438|strangely enough i felt very sharp.
p247_439|an alternative must be offered.
p247_440|the boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p247_441|there is no hiding place.
p247_442|their condition is described as satisfactory.
p247_443|last week against nelson we allowed them several opportunities.
p247_444|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p247_445|senior management in scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p247_446|it wouldn't matter if he had.
p247_447|that will be best for him.
p247_448|there were no formal announcements.
p247_449|he deserves a second chance.
p247_450|it certainly appeared that way.
p247_451|but you can go beyond that condition.
p247_452|blair is very positive at european councils.
p247_453|it could cause a little bit of disruption.
p247_454|police have appealed for witnesses.
p247_455|people are so negative about the whole business.
p247_456|discussions will continue with the industry in scotland.
p247_457|it recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
p247_458|it might be useful to have something in black and white.
p247_459|the damage is all inside.
p247_460|the boys are mentally focused.
p247_461|it's because they can't understand the language.
p247_462|then came the farewell to europe.
p247_463|the edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p247_464|i'm very passionate about my country.
p247_465|phil mickelson did that last year.
p247_466|i think it's a great system.
p247_467|they're just a good retailer.
p247_468|that should get their attention.
p247_469|now that business is banned.
p247_470|they were good years for him.
p247_471|at the moment social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p247_472|and it covers the spectrum.
p247_473|we will now look into its historical background.
p247_474|they were impressive against france.
p247_475|the chief constable has retired.
p247_476|it will concentrate on the thames valley.
p247_477|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p247_479|that was the first time i worked with richard.
p248_001|please call stella.
p248_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p248_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p248_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p248_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p248_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p248_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p248_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p248_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p248_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p248_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p248_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p248_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p248_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p248_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p248_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p248_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p248_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p248_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p248_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p248_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p248_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p248_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p248_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p248_025|she is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p248_026|it's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p248_027|but it failed.
p248_028|that's no bad thing.
p248_029|the main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p248_030|i have a theory.
p248_031|because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p248_032|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p248_033|they should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p248_034|suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p248_035|i expected these kind of questions.
p248_036|it's a matter of balance.
p248_037|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p248_038|but it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p248_039|it was clear.
p248_040|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p248_041|she is believed to be in south africa.
p248_042|i was scared.
p248_043|it was ugly.
p248_044|that is a break with tradition.
p248_045|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p248_046|no meaningful response was issued.
p248_047|it is urgent.
p248_048|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p248_049|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p248_050|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p248_051|but it might have done.
p248_052|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p248_053|he looks like an afghan.
p248_054|they had to explain it.
p248_055|here's a clue.
p248_056|but the law is very clear on this.
p248_057|next league matches celtic.
p248_058|it's very odd.
p248_059|it will take time.
p248_060|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p248_061|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p248_062|four other charges were dropped.
p248_063|it is not great art.
p248_064|it's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p248_065|scotland had great assets.
p248_066|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p248_067|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p248_068|it's good news and long overdue.
p248_069|have a look at our accounts.
p248_070|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p248_071|there was an e mail.
p248_072|then followed a bout of flu.
p248_073|neither it is.
p248_074|i had my suspicions.
p248_075|he got the same story.
p248_076|it works for us.
p248_077|it is a time bomb.
p248_078|today she has been released.
p248_079|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p248_080|it may well have been.
p248_081|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p248_082|nothing is yet confirmed.
p248_083|new zealand rugby is totally different.
p248_084|we have other options.
p248_085|by then he was walking on water.
p248_086|it's never too late.
p248_087|others were in hiding in fear of their lives.
p248_088|global scotland will be held at the glasgow royal concert hall.
p248_089|they lived for their children.
p248_090|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p248_091|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p248_092|i decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p248_093|he was possessed
p248_094|i have every confidence in raymond robertson as chairman of the party.
p248_095|scotland will have strong defences as part of the united kingdom.
p248_096|it is a delight on every level.
p248_097|i had a ball today.
p248_098|two of the team became ill.
p248_099|that's all right then.
p248_100|that would be unlawful.
p248_101|that time is not now however.
p248_102|oil embargo endorsed.
p248_103|i didn't play well last year.
p248_104|that is no use.
p248_105|that all hope is never lost.
p248_106|health secretary frank dobson made the surprise announcement in the commons yesterday.
p248_107|he pleaded for caution.
p248_108|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p248_109|i thought it was a fantastic game.
p248_110|it had been played at festivals.
p248_111|we do not expect any surplus.
p248_112|naturally it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p248_113|holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p248_114|it's not a new concept in jazz.
p248_115|this is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p248_116|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p248_117|maybe this battle has been.
p248_118|but the fans deserve to know
p248_119|until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p248_120|they've got to account for it.
p248_121|she's got to say something.
p248_122|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p248_123|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p248_124|i can't even get into the a team.
p248_125|she does not want to speak.
p248_126|it's terrible that he has died the same way.
p248_127|so the european elections are extremely important.
p248_128|some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p248_129|wish i could be there on sunday in person but i can't.
p248_130|i had relied on him.
p248_131|the whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p248_132|it's the big omission.
p248_133|it plans to return to this field.
p248_134|our intentions are real.
p248_135|government will intervene.
p248_136|yesterday mr hague dismissed the poll.
p248_137|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p248_138|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p248_139|it was typical.
p248_140|i was the last man to touch the ball.
p248_141|he has the edge.
p248_142|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p248_143|it's a crucial award.
p248_144|he is severe.
p248_145|there is a lack of chemistry.
p248_146|this film will be totally awesome.
p248_147|that could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p248_148|it is like a football team.
p248_149|last month he made his debut in japan.
p248_150|it's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p248_151|it is huge.
p248_152|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p248_153|the departure of mr johnston was reported by the herald yesterday.
p248_154|it's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p248_155|they were later discharged from hospital.
p248_156|that includes the equipment?
p248_157|they should stop the bombing.
p248_158|that's the name of the game though.
p248_159|a labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p248_160|they are expected to appear at edinburgh sheriff court today.
p248_161|eight months later he was dead.
p248_162|it has to be now.
p248_163|it could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p248_164|i was in the train station overnight.
p248_165|we knew we had the goal we wanted.
p248_166|it's that sort of night.
p248_167|we have a budget in march.
p248_168|by then however both men were already in the us.
p248_169|the post will be unpaid.
p248_170|last weekend in germany he missed the cut.
p248_171|waiting times for these services are too long.
p248_172|they thought they had found a home.
p248_173|you have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p248_174|the jury is still out.
p248_175|blair's response was weak.
p248_176|it s the real thing for sure.
p248_177|and i saw the light
p248_178|there is no evidence of a little scotland emerging.
p248_179|tony had arrived.
p248_180|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p248_181|the goals were good.
p248_182|i've been there.
p248_183|four policemen were wounded.
p248_184|they receive a high profile in the media.
p248_185|we did everything by the book.
p248_186|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p248_187|they need to look after themselves.
p248_188|what has caused the demise of singing?
p248_189|you know the sort of thing.
p248_190|i cannot say too much about them.
p248_191|it was an odd affair in many respects.
p248_192|all options are open.
p248_193|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p248_194|however this idea is never developed.
p248_195|it wasn't to be.
p248_196|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p248_197|it's the same old story.
p248_198|it was still there but right at the end.
p248_199|there would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p248_200|the service from the other players was super.
p248_201|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p248_202|but she might be.
p248_203|it's just awful.
p248_204|today was first class.
p248_205|it was worth a photograph.
p248_206|we have an election in eight days.
p248_207|now it's all right.
p248_208|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p248_209|the aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p248_210|harry potter has lost his magic.
p248_211|he is slightly confused.
p248_212|the proposals are to be debated on monday by city councillors.
p248_213|twaddle is a case in point.
p248_214|it had all been arranged.
p248_215|in each case they were a goal down.
p248_216|i've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p248_217|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p248_218|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p248_219|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p248_220|friends of the earth scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p248_221|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p248_222|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p248_223|i am very sorry that alastair campbell has taken this decision.
p248_224|it was good fun.
p248_225|i have spoken to the skipper.
p248_226|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p248_227|the track is currently covered in snow.
p248_228|but he failed to win the committee's support.
p248_229|at the time he was a living legend.
p248_230|it's the same as glasgow.
p248_231|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p248_232|police later said the scheme would end in november.
p248_233|it is set in paris.
p248_234|they should come forward.
p248_235|i haven't made the donation yet.
p248_236|it's very safe.
p248_237|it is not an option but a policy requirement.
p248_238|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p248_239|it is no surprise.
p248_240|my future is in the marathon.
p248_241|we have a free vote on these things in our party.
p248_242|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p248_243|she is well balanced.
p248_244|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p248_245|it is hard won.
p248_246|the scene is about this?
p248_247|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p248_248|it's a record label not a form of music.
p248_249|it was a cry for help.
p248_250|it was a hit.
p248_251|this year i understood.
p248_252|i've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p248_253|at the end of the day one has to be careful.
p248_254|we run within the law.
p248_255|kirkwood was arrested.
p248_256|they fail to engage.
p248_257|they are real.
p248_258|they must play for each other.
p248_259|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p248_260|it is also very valuable.
p248_261|an appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p248_262|that is highly unfair.
p248_263|he will emerge as a world leader.
p248_264|they want to shut the scottish office.
p248_265|this is a question of islam.
p248_266|of course that is not the whole story.
p248_267|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p248_268|i am totally horrified by the sentence.
p248_269|immediate action must be taken.
p248_270|he is a young man with a new deal.
p248_271|he was also married with two children.
p248_272|he's been here on numerous occasions.
p248_273|it's a way of life.
p248_274|i feel pretty good.
p248_275|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p248_276|if not he should go home.
p248_277|he looked very sharp.
p248_278|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p248_279|you've got to have both sides.
p248_280|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p248_281|he will address the nation this evening.
p248_282|it was a virus.
p248_283|maloney is an engaging talent.
p248_284|it shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p248_285|it is a vote of confidence in the skills in scotland.
p248_286|but it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p248_287|it is not normal practice.
p248_288|the release attracted little attention.
p248_289|the move was welcomed by the roman catholic church in scotland.
p248_290|it s all in the hair.
p248_291|what has altered?
p248_292|i thought it was my only chance.
p248_293|the award to senator mitchell was announced by the foreign office.
p248_294|our task is to complete the picture.
p248_295|davis is very supportive as a director.
p248_296|we believe the world has too many refugees already.
p248_297|we are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p248_298|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p248_299|scotland has shown the way.
p248_300|it wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p248_301|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p248_302|let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p248_303|the court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p248_304|we have waited a long time for this.
p248_305|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p248_306|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p248_307|it should be equal.
p248_308|craig is a major concern for us.
p248_309|he then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p248_310|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p248_311|other people had looked at it.
p248_312|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p248_313|off with their heads.
p248_314|the parents will have a great time too.
p248_315|donald was his friend.
p248_316|i think i was recorded with a video camera.
p248_317|he was unable to come.
p248_318|i saw some good things.
p248_319|it is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p248_320|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p248_321|her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p248_322|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p248_323|who will do it?
p248_324|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p248_325|i'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p248_326|this is the way things should be handled.
p248_327|the train was on time.
p248_328|you were very proud that day to be among their friends.
p248_329|he has to learn.
p248_330|indeed it was magical.
p248_331|there's no place to hide.
p248_332|it will be very very tight.
p248_333|i said that i had been raped.
p248_334|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p248_335|the composer will conduct.
p248_336|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p248_337|like his acting it was an accident.
p248_338|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p248_339|it's the last thing on my mind.
p248_340|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p248_341|i'd like to take the plunge.
p248_342|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p248_343|it is horrible.
p248_344|they say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p248_345|i kept going for her.
p248_346|tyson is overwhelmed.
p248_347|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p248_348|but nothing happened.
p248_349|but the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p248_350|no other job in world football can compare to this one.
p248_351|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p248_352|he has seen the past.
p248_353|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p248_354|it was that bad that low.
p248_355|that would help.
p248_356|mr anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p248_357|who was the mystery mp?
p248_358|we have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p248_359|he later became a respected high court judge.
p248_360|he could face a jail sentence.
p248_361|the final decision was between scotland and the republic of ireland.
p248_362|now though he has an incentive.
p248_363|they have not done so this season so far.
p248_364|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p248_365|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p248_366|it is legally binding.
p248_367|well the big day has arrived.
p248_368|five members were disciplined.
p248_369|there is no signature.
p248_370|i am a wealthy person.
p248_371|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p248_372|colour was at the core of his life.
p248_373|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p248_374|he's a lovely young man.
p248_375|the casualties were not named.
p248_376|a ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p249_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p249_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p249_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p249_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p249_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p249_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p249_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p249_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p249_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p249_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p249_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p249_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p249_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p249_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p249_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p249_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p249_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p249_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p249_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p249_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p249_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p249_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p249_025|she is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p249_026|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p249_027|it's nice to hear.
p249_028|they should be so lucky.
p249_029|because we do not need it.
p249_030|there's a story too.
p249_031|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p249_032|he took me on a tour of the wards.
p249_033|a search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p249_034|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p249_035|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p249_036|it was clear.
p249_037|it is not for any other purpose.
p249_038|he did not know his daughter.
p249_039|she is believed to be in south africa.
p249_040|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p249_041|sure it's funny.
p249_042|it's a crucial award.
p249_043|the boy is no longer with us.
p249_044|it's a blessing.
p249_045|is a drug dealer?
p249_046|as she explains.
p249_047|he is too weak to move.
p249_048|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p249_049|i would love to have him home.
p249_050|he looks like an afghan.
p249_051|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p249_052|it will come all right.
p249_053|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p249_054|next league matches celtic.
p249_055|it happens from time to time.
p249_056|it's very odd.
p249_057|already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p249_058|it is unique.
p249_059|it will take time.
p249_060|that's the truth.
p249_061|jobs could go.
p249_062|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p249_063|i'm just enjoying every match.
p249_064|and a film maker was born.
p249_065|you did not change overnight.
p249_066|there was a battle there.
p249_067|scotland had great assets.
p249_068|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p249_069|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p249_070|have a look at our accounts.
p249_071|it is like a river running by my home.
p249_072|try to save us.
p249_073|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p249_074|sounds like the sixth sense?
p249_075|painful but only because it's true.
p249_076|the play is based on a real life event.
p249_077|it's very difficult to find a buyer.
p249_078|he highlighted a lack of staff.
p249_079|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p249_080|both sides have been hit by injury.
p249_081|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p249_082|it is a job creation scheme.
p249_083|even the one she loved.
p249_084|i've not thought about it.
p249_086|until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p249_087|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p249_088|she had kept the news from him.
p249_089|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p249_090|when people talk about the beach boys and brian wilson.
p249_092|every time i play i do not understand their reaction.
p249_093|and rugby fans can help.
p249_094|they lived for their children.
p249_095|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p249_096|now the system is right behind us.
p249_097|every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p249_098|today i couldn't run on it.
p249_099|however it did not end that way.
p249_100|we must look forward.
p249_101|it is an old family habit.
p249_102|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p249_103|until you hit the big games.
p249_104|then came the crunch.
p249_105|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p249_106|we have always maintained that we would never abandon scottish football.
p249_107|he is hungry for success and i am the same.
p249_108|the court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p249_109|it is a good day for the coalition.
p249_110|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p249_111|we want to get to the final anyway.
p249_112|it is a good lifestyle.
p249_113|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p249_114|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p249_115|you had better believe it.
p249_116|holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p249_117|it's a long process.
p249_118|they were behind the wheel.
p249_119|it was ugly.
p249_120|thereafter he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p249_121|this is the end of a chapter and it is very sad.
p249_122|does this mean.
p249_123|they've got to account for it.
p249_124|who would have?
p249_125|the whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p249_126|you can spend money on housing.
p249_127|there were no grounds for his action.
p249_128|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p249_129|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p249_130|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
p249_131|our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p249_132|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p249_133|she said she could not believe that they had run away.
p249_134|we're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p249_135|certainly in terms of league position we must be favourites.
p249_136|what will happen then?
p249_137|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p249_138|mr hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p249_139|it was very frightened and dirty.
p249_140|i was the last man to touch the ball.
p249_141|it's a question of fashion.
p249_142|we need to chat.
p249_143|wallace was a prisoner of war.
p249_144|he is severe.
p249_145|it is difficult for ali.
p249_146|is that titanic?
p249_147|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p249_148|the idea is simple.
p249_149|that could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p249_150|it is like a football team.
p249_152|it is not just about pay.
p249_153|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p249_154|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p249_155|the weaknesses are few.
p249_156|the woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p249_157|it is not normal practice.
p249_159|it was by the numbers.
p249_160|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p249_161|there's a pause.
p249_162|neither side can win this war.
p249_163|they should stop the bombing.
p249_164|alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p249_165|these days are long gone.
p249_166|it is an attitude of mind.
p249_167|it's a logical consequence of the formula.
p249_168|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p249_169|they say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
p249_170|i'm so worried about the roads.
p249_171|we have to move forward.
p249_172|tell it like it was?
p249_173|it is not too late to get on board.
p249_174|we have a budget in march.
p249_176|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p249_177|as far as we were concerned the deal with kennedy was dead.
p249_178|the release attracted little attention.
p249_179|someone who cares
p249_180|i always felt they played for me.
p249_181|you have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p249_182|the jury is still out.
p249_183|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p249_184|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p249_185|it is not either national standards or local control.
p249_186|it should be easy.
p249_187|everyone can be bought.
p249_188|we are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p249_189|we've got a lot of respect for the lions.
p249_190|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p249_191|it is not fair.
p249_192|miller was every bit as happy.
p249_193|we want to help them through it.
p249_194|i put the drawing down.
p249_196|i had a train to catch.
p249_197|it is tough but possible.
p249_198|we are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p249_199|however this idea is never developed.
p249_200|last night was a key episode.
p249_201|we have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p249_202|it is a case of taking a risk.
p249_203|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p249_204|sir paul mccartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
p249_205|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p249_206|there would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p249_207|the service from the other players was super.
p249_208|he has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
p249_209|i have a cold.
p249_210|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p249_211|ferguson should take note.
p249_212|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p249_213|the album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p249_214|it's all about money money money.
p249_216|we will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p249_217|this is a good move for me.
p249_218|but i am a worried man.
p249_219|there was an e mail.
p249_220|feel the heat?
p249_221|we'll have to work hard today.
p249_222|twaddle is a case in point.
p249_223|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p249_224|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p249_225|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p249_226|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p249_229|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p249_230|and the farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p249_231|it is a gamble.
p249_232|my neighbours are horrified.
p249_234|he is in the queue.
p249_235|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p249_236|broke the birdie record.
p249_237|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p249_238|we were a load of rubbish.
p249_239|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p249_240|it's a lovely lovely film.
p249_241|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p249_243|the problem in norway is outside the national.
p249_244|we have a free vote on these things in our party.
p249_245|we have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p249_246|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p249_247|there wasn't a goal.
p249_248|i was shocked.
p249_249|i should think so too.
p249_251|scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p249_252|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p249_253|at the end of the day one has to be careful.
p249_254|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p249_255|it is very important that we get the balance right.
p249_256|it will now relate to all public bodies in scotland.
p249_257|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p249_258|they must play for each other.
p249_259|his contract was then not renewed.
p249_260|he raised the profile of the european tour to the sky.
p249_261|that's the only thing i will say.
p249_262|blood samples were taken.
p249_263|they are never here.
p249_265|he has not created a festival resource.
p249_266|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p249_267|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p249_268|it is the same in sweden.
p249_269|and michael was just great.
p249_270|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p249_271|it's not even finished.
p249_272|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p249_273|things can change.
p249_274|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p249_275|people have no choice.
p249_276|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p249_277|he has a wealth of experience.
p249_278|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p249_279|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p249_280|there's nothing i can say.
p249_281|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p249_282|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p249_283|you've got to have both sides.
p249_284|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p249_285|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p249_286|the government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p249_287|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p249_288|scotland were beaten again.
p249_289|a tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p249_290|i do not think this family will ever get over this.
p249_291|these figures are truly awful.
p249_292|he should have won.
p249_293|sunday's game was not a trial.
p249_294|a new school will be built.
p249_295|the move was welcomed by the roman catholic church in scotland.
p249_296|mark fisher was a guest of the northern ireland tourist board.
p249_297|what has altered?
p249_298|however the snow was welcomed by some.
p249_299|he was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p249_300|our task is to complete the picture.
p249_301|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p249_302|they are wrong.
p249_303|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p249_304|the whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p249_305|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p249_306|they were on holiday in egypt.
p249_307|i was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p249_308|and he goes with it.
p249_309|it wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p249_310|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p249_311|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p249_312|i will not allow the destruction of the scottish fishing industry.
p249_313|is there on his hands?
p249_314|special measures were needed.
p249_315|they were fantastic.
p249_316|in fact they have the opposite effect.
p249_317|they wanted the club to make money.
p249_318|the problems began a long time ago.
p249_319|referees are easy targets.
p249_320|davis is very supportive as a director.
p249_321|i came into this world with nothing.
p249_322|that's the law of the land.
p249_323|there was no time scale.
p249_324|i am so upset.
p249_326|it could have gone either way.
p249_327|he was then replaced by ross.
p249_328|my view has now completely changed.
p249_329|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p249_330|work is under way to create a studio in inverness.
p249_331|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p249_332|who will do it?
p249_335|i must make that clear.
p249_336|the train was on time.
p249_337|a new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p249_338|the announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p249_339|that is the very reason why it was so vital.
p249_340|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p249_341|i was pleased to be back on the podium in brazil.
p249_342|he's a genius.
p249_343|they should take their mobile phones.
p249_344|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p249_345|eight months later he was dead.
p249_347|it's all going to clear the debt.
p249_348|he had played well in that central role.
p249_349|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p249_350|it is horrible.
p249_351|it was very formal.
p249_352|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p249_353|i kept going for her.
p249_354|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p250_001|please call stella.
p250_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p250_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p250_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p250_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p250_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p250_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p250_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p250_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p250_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p250_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p250_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p250_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p250_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p250_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p250_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p250_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p250_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.

p250_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p250_025|a shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p250_026|meetings will also remain private.

p250_126|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p250_127|i understand the medical concerns.
p250_128|that's not an assumption that i had made.
p250_129|i have learned from him.
p250_130|the situation is not easy but we will prevail.
p250_131|he thought she was amazing.
p250_132|figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p250_133|this is a milestone in the modernisation of the scottish prosecution service.
p250_134|it isn't a happy memory.
p250_135|we have a team to reach the final.
p250_136|failure is not an option.
p250_137|she's got to say something.
p250_138|he is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p250_139|this is a frightening development.
p250_140|it is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p250_141|that first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p250_142|that is far too high.
p250_143|my life has changed a lot.
p250_144|we did what we had to do.
p250_146|you've got to be vigilant.
p250_147|you are a gambling man.
p250_148|i had decided to quit the show.
p250_149|losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p250_150|it was finally agreed on saturday.
p250_151|i love the spectacle of cinema.
p250_152|we will try to find someone.
p250_153|she died at her home.
p250_154|what happened in that game ?
p250_155|are you going to win ?
p250_156|was it the wife ?
p250_157|why change it ?
p250_158|what do we want to do that for ?
p250_159|frankly it was worth the booking.
p250_160|he was pleased with his display.
p250_161|life is still very tough for them.
p250_162|it is not just about pay.
p250_163|it opens the door to the champions league.
p250_164|anyway the job will be part time.
p250_165|it has become a way of life.
p250_166|the whole industry is a shambles.
p250_167|people were actually not on his side.
p250_168|the defender made an impressive debut.
p250_169|there's only one team in ayrshire.
p250_170|crucially though united were still alive.
p250_171|they have not been named.
p250_172|the point is raised again that evening at the assembly rooms.
p250_173|yesterday abbey national said it had injected further capital into scottish provident.
p250_174|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p250_175|he was asked to quit.
p250_176|this action reflects a slump in bookings.
p250_177|being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p250_178|i'd love to be like peter.
p250_179|you will be very welcome.
p250_180|it had so much to do with output.
p250_181|that would open the gates of hell.
p250_182|further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p250_183|the reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p250_184|they could not match it.
p250_185|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p250_186|but the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p250_187|this championship is different from the other majors.
p250_188|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p250_189|it appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p250_190|the new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p250_191|our fans have been marvellous.
p250_192|this could be an amazing attraction for glasgow.
p250_193|they need to look after themselves.
p250_194|miller was every bit as happy.
p250_195|they were seriously after him.
p250_196|it was a bit like having children.
p250_197|aberdeen had little to offer.
p250_198|we represent a wide range of society.
p250_199|he was rejected because he had retired.
p250_200|we always felt we could win.
p250_201|it may have been a cry for help.
p250_202|this year it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p250_204|we are going through difficult times.
p250_205|we've had an enjoyable adventure.
p250_206|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p250_207|you could feel the heat.
p250_208|we have to be happy with a british and european record.
p250_209|it was a moment of madness.
p250_210|and we have the experience.
p250_211|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p250_212|it gave no further details.
p250_214|i won't make an official complaint.
p250_215|british midland has applied for permission to fly to the us.
p250_216|it was worth a photograph.
p250_217|the move follows a review of the singapore
p250_218|it carried a double message.
p250_219|flanker gordon simpson may also feature in that match.
p250_220|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p250_221|that might help a bit.
p250_222|does the name matter ?
p250_223|how do you get it back ?
p250_224|what are you not good at ?
p250_225|i think therefore i am ?
p250_226|who was she ?
p250_227|harry potter has lost his magic.
p250_228|today we must not repeat that mistake.
p250_229|it had all been arranged.
p250_230|my daughter is an adult.
p250_231|his third goal was superb.
p250_232|it will affect their work.
p250_233|basically they have to come up with the offer.
p250_234|i am considered a teenager.
p250_235|the process will start tomorrow.
p250_236|it's just a normal life.
p250_237|the transaction is not feasible.
p250_238|i wouldn't even respond to that question.
p250_239|it is good for our team.
p250_240|friends of the earth scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p250_241|that you can do it.
p250_242|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p250_243|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p250_244|during the communist time they were very privileged.
p250_245|they all made the european ryder cup team.
p250_246|his background is firmly in venture capital.
p250_247|the plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p250_248|i have spoken to the skipper.
p250_249|a small number of new jobs will also be created.
p250_250|she will attend in july.
p250_251|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p250_252|the most important thing is the game.
p250_253|there is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
p250_254|paterson can afford to be generous.
p250_255|the right decision has been made.
p250_257|many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p250_258|customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p250_260|employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p250_261|he was good but not that good.
p250_262|at half time he was presented to both teams.
p250_263|he needed a kidney it is as simple as that.
p250_264|he is a reporter for us.
p250_265|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p250_266|either way the investor retains the premium.
p250_267|we've had several problems over injuries.
p250_268|that was a disgraceful performance.
p250_269|reaction from scottish business leaders was mixed.
p250_270|it was a kind of contempt.
p250_271|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p250_272|i should think so too.
p250_273|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p250_274|messages have to be reinforced.
p250_275|i got a yellow card.
p250_276|this is no reflection on rangers.
p250_277|we accept the new rules.
p250_278|they are interior designers and architects.
p250_280|i rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p250_281|their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p250_282|we are aiming for early march.
p250_283|i felt about this big.
p250_284|and they were being paid ?
p250_285|was everything done to save people ?
p250_286|what was the matter for concern ?
p250_287|do i think about them often ?
p250_288|is it in the right place ?
p250_289|it is also very valuable.
p250_290|i feel really confident in that department.
p250_291|this could put pressure on uk inflation.
p250_292|companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
p250_293|the morale of the yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p250_294|i'm so proud to be scottish tonight.
p250_295|we shall rely on human beings.
p250_296|it has the potential to be another north sea.
p250_297|we would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
p250_298|he has not created a festival resource.
p250_299|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p250_300|i understand the security issue.
p250_301|frankly we should all have such problems.
p250_302|it was an easy decision to come here.
p250_304|he ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p250_305|funding would come from both scotland and northern ireland.
p250_306|no one wanted to run it tonight.
p250_308|we have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p250_309|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p250_310|you have to expect this type of thing.
p250_311|stephen will get his first cap.
p250_312|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p250_313|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p250_314|the circumstances have changed since last year.
p250_315|it's all designed to speed up the service.
p250_316|i wanted to change the formula.
p250_317|he will address the nation this evening.
p250_318|i couldn't really work outside edinburgh.
p250_319|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p250_320|we would hope to make progress on that next year.
p250_321|again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p250_322|the effect was almost magical.
p250_323|and that culture is everywhere in dublin.
p250_324|holland won by five wickets.
p250_325|there's still no one like him.
p250_326|mcnaughton was not so sure.
p250_327|i was brought up in a mining background.
p250_328|i thought his speech was a disgrace.
p250_329|the takeover comes as no surprise.
p250_330|job losses were also announced.
p250_331|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p250_332|we believe the world has too many refugees already.
p250_333|the party lasted all night.
p250_334|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p250_335|it was nice to finish in style.
p250_336|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p250_337|completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
p250_338|and he goes with it.
p250_339|scotland has shown the way.
p250_340|there will be good prospects ahead.
p250_341|will have consequences for scottish universities.
p250_342|the letters are going out today.
p250_343|i'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p250_344|we will listen to any suggestion.
p250_345|the premier league has been a huge success.
p250_346|he has made his base in spain.
p250_348|a home office spokesman said.
p250_349|urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p250_350|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p250_351|it was tough to contain the excitement.
p250_352|the pain is still acute.
p250_353|shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p250_354|it's wonderful to have won.
p250_355|many of these properties are located in the south of england.
p250_356|i'd like to take the plunge.
p250_357|finally came the moment of truth.
p250_358|we have very limited capacity.
p250_359|is our children learning ?
p250_360|what form did that take ?
p250_361|are they free ?
p250_362|is there a waiting list ?
p250_363|in general terms the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p250_364|three years ago he would have been.
p250_365|it has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p250_366|look at the liberal democrats.
p250_367|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p250_368|we put our bid in last night.
p250_369|he had no access to the database.
p250_370|we're still the only ones in the high street.
p250_371|i was delighted to accept.
p250_372|they should take their mobile phones.
p250_374|it's fantastic to win again.
p250_375|we are really good friends.
p250_376|the salary changes are long overdue.
p250_377|those people must be accountable.
p250_378|she said they would appeal.
p250_379|the countryside is in crisis.
p250_380|there is no deal as yet.
p250_381|it's as wide as a church in here.
p250_382|she is obviously very disappointed.
p250_383|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p250_384|they will fight for everything.
p250_385|we will win the argument.
p250_386|is it worth it ?
p250_387|does it matter ?
p250_388|how do you take them away ?
p250_389|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p250_390|after the match do you ?
p250_391|the team hadn't been picked.
p250_392|no other job in world football can compare to this one.
p250_393|one third of the places are already taken.
p250_394|i always knew she was funny.
p250_395|everyone could see the joke.
p250_396|the marshall at the turn was great.
p250_397|there isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p250_398|he has earned the right to their respect.
p250_399|the law would appear to be on our side.
p250_400|there was a substantial explosion.
p250_401|the hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p250_402|theatre is not a museum.
p250_403|the government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p250_404|it has only been rumours.
p250_405|i was conceived in aberdeen.
p250_406|rugby is a hard game.
p250_407|my immune system had been depleted.
p250_408|offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p250_409|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p250_410|growth will come later in the cycle.
p250_411|we're not taking any risks.
p250_412|neither man has been charged.
p250_413|i had a fortunate war.
p250_414|the choice is strictly personal.
p250_415|it's too close to call.
p250_416|the breakdown was much later in her life.
p250_417|it became a national network.
p250_418|it is a large number.
p250_419|she started to put on weight.
p250_420|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p250_421|i wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p250_422|the bbc was a disgrace.
p250_423|russell is delighted with them.
p250_424|the next few months will tell.
p250_425|it is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p250_426|the second goal was superb.
p250_427|i am astonished at attack.
p250_428|there is a solution she believes.
p250_429|that was the agreement with the manager.
p250_430|he's had to suffer for the last six years.
p250_431|his ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p250_432|being captain of this club is fantastic.
p250_433|first minister donald dewar will respond.
p250_434|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p250_435|no date has been fixed for his return.
p250_436|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p250_437|the trial will open today.
p250_438|national farmer's union of scotland president jim walker welcomed the new proposals.
p250_439|i never won a penny throughout my career.
p250_440|this is a good day for scottish farming.
p250_441|there were a lot of emotions.
p250_442|we have not yet received a letter from the irish.
p250_443|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p250_444|we know about the crisis in cattle.
p250_445|everything in golf is a balance.
p250_446|last week against nelson we allowed them several opportunities.
p250_447|external auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
p250_448|the people around me were fantastic.
p250_449|that will be best for him.
p250_450|and we might go back.
p250_451|the project is entitled the composer in scotland.
p250_452|the villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p250_453|but you can go beyond that condition.
p250_454|the removal would take place in france.
p250_455|it is a tough game but we have a chance.
p250_456|but we have built a platform for next season.
p250_457|i think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p250_458|they had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p250_459|the jury is still out.
p250_460|it was like someone had died.
p250_461|the budget was too low for that.
p250_462|neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner up.
p250_463|striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p250_464|the damage is all inside.
p250_465|let that be their memorial.
p250_466|the boys are mentally focused.
p250_467|this is the stuff of live music.
p250_468|it may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
p250_469|the move is considered a major breakthrough.
p250_471|i see no reason to have this debate at this time.
p250_472|he certainly did a good job
p250_473|talks between directors have been underway since last month.
p250_474|i am certainly thinking about retirement.
p250_475|at the moment social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p250_476|i have always believed in myself.
p250_477|the chief constable has retired.
p250_478|well he is an artist.
p250_479|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p250_480|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p250_481|their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
p250_482|that was the first time i worked with richard.
p250_483|that argument has been won.
p250_484|it was a narrow escape.
p250_485|and rugby fans can help.
p250_486|he was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p250_487|the processing plant was closed yesterday.
p250_488|the israeli military denied the claim.
p250_489|he is not a dancer.
p250_490|i cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p250_491|it has been the year of the youngster at kilmarnock.
p250_492|these people attack the core of my beliefs.
p250_493|the striker needed attention before he could resume.
p250_494|i am delighted for everyone in airdrie.
p250_495|we would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
p250_496|subsidy income will not be affected.
p251_001|please call stella.
p251_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p251_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p251_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p251_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p251_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p251_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p251_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p251_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p251_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p251_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p251_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p251_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p251_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p251_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p251_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p251_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p251_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p251_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p251_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p251_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p251_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p251_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p251_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p251_025|johnson was pretty low.
p251_026|but it failed.
p251_027|that's no bad thing.
p251_028|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p251_029|however the following year the cancer returned.
p251_030|so if we can take anything from tonight it will be fantastic.
p251_032|it's a matter of balance.
p251_033|peace was won.
p251_034|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p251_035|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p251_036|was it worth it?
p251_037|at this stage we think the air campaign is enough.
p251_038|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p251_039|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p251_040|it was clear.
p251_041|they may be wrong.
p251_042|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p251_043|dancing was her life.
p251_044|we will push.
p251_045|i feel pretty good.
p251_046|that should do it.
p251_047|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p251_048|as she explains.
p251_049|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p251_050|it is the whole package.
p251_051|he had no enemies.
p251_052|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p251_053|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p251_054|i had relied on him.
p251_055|this is a step backwards.
p251_056|already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p251_057|what was the main difference?
p251_058|four other charges were dropped.
p251_059|it's a real challenge.
p251_060|it is not great art.
p251_061|they're appalled by that.
p251_062|it's that kind of place.
p251_063|it was all in a short period of time.
p251_064|an appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p251_065|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p251_066|he was popular.
p251_067|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p251_068|that was the easy election.
p251_069|there could be a way back.
p251_070|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p251_071|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p251_072|it was chaotic.
p251_073|it is a time bomb.
p251_074|i've not thought about it.
p251_075|today she has been released.
p251_076|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p251_077|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p251_078|i was too young.
p251_079|the tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p251_080|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p251_081|war is not the action.
p251_082|you will be.
p251_083|others were in hiding in fear of their lives.
p251_084|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p251_085|we have turned the corner.
p251_087|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p251_088|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p251_089|we must look forward.
p251_090|it is an old family habit.
p251_091|until you hit the big games.
p251_092|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p251_093|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p251_094|if you could find it.
p251_095|scotland will have strong defences as part of the united kingdom.
p251_096|journalists should make him.
p251_097|they were outside the circle.
p251_098|two of the team became ill.
p251_099|that would be unlawful.
p251_100|no date has been set for the appeal.
p251_101|it is a good lifestyle.
p251_102|that is no use.
p251_103|they had to be cut from the wreckage.
p251_104|further protests are likely.
p251_105|i was fighting for my life i thought.
p251_106|he was jailed for a year.
p251_107|it had been played at festivals.
p251_108|i came to complete.
p251_109|you had better believe it.
p251_110|i was angry.
p251_111|the fire was above the hole.
p251_112|this is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p251_113|we are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p251_114|it's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p251_115|maybe this battle has been.
p251_116|i joined a group.
p251_117|does this mean.
p251_118|it is rubbish.
p251_119|this is the first big idea of the scottish parliament election.
p251_120|we work on the same level.
p251_121|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p251_122|she has been shot.
p251_123|i'm so angry.
p251_124|it's terrible that he has died the same way.
p251_125|our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p251_126|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p251_127|some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p251_128|well you can have a tree.
p251_129|it was the same at twickenham.
p251_130|we had a reunion last week.
p251_131|if not a deal could take many months.
p251_132|government will intervene.
p251_133|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p251_134|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p251_135|mr hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p251_136|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p251_137|we are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p251_138|is that it?
p251_139|i had decided to quit the show.
p251_140|i am totally devoted to this job.
p251_141|three penalties were given.
p251_142|and the farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p251_143|we just had a go.
p251_144|we have seen a copy of the report.
p251_145|the songs are just so good.
p251_146|it is like a football team.
p251_147|that group reported just before christmas.
p251_148|he sets the nature of his parliament in a simple realistic context.
p251_149|you know the type.
p251_150|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p251_151|but he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p251_152|he seemed to lose his focus.
p251_153|it is not normal practice.
p251_154|there's a sense of excess in the novel.
p251_155|i knew he was good.
p251_156|i saw one body.
p251_157|there's a pause.
p251_158|neither side can win this war.
p251_159|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p251_160|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p251_161|eight months later he was dead.
p251_162|we have to move forward.
p251_163|however the french government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p251_164|tell it like it was?
p251_165|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p251_166|by then however both men were already in the us.
p251_167|you are not going in blind.
p251_168|the post will be unpaid.
p251_169|last weekend in germany he missed the cut.
p251_170|they thought they had found a home.
p251_171|i always felt they played for me.
p251_172|mr blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p251_173|one season they might do well.
p251_174|the jury is still out.
p251_175|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p251_176|it is not either national standards or local control.
p251_177|the conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p251_178|we are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p251_179|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p251_180|we knew nothing about it.
p251_181|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p251_182|four policemen were wounded.
p251_183|we did everything by the book.
p251_184|what has caused the demise of singing?
p251_185|we want to help them through it.
p251_186|i cannot say too much about them.
p251_187|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p251_188|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p251_189|people will ask about us.
p251_190|however this idea is never developed.
p251_191|last night was a key episode.
p251_192|we have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p251_193|the spokeswoman said the flat in london was very small.
p251_194|mr kennedy is not a candidate for the scottish parliament.
p251_195|it is a case of taking a risk.
p251_196|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p251_197|it wasn't to be.
p251_198|it was typical.
p251_199|it's the same old story.
p251_200|the confidence is low but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p251_201|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p251_202|there was no option.
p251_203|the conference is the first test.
p251_204|i saw some terrible things.
p251_205|they've got three quarters of the way.
p251_206|a deadline is still essential.
p251_207|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p251_208|we see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p251_209|today was first class.
p251_210|some realism was needed about time resources and management.
p251_211|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p251_212|we have an election in eight days.
p251_213|now it's all right.
p251_214|there was an e mail.
p251_215|her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p251_216|twaddle is a case in point.
p251_217|i began to pray.
p251_218|a grampian police spokesman said.
p251_219|we have got to get it right.
p251_220|the second is the reaction of the hibs fans.
p251_221|a final decision will be taken by first minister donald dewar.
p251_222|work has started.
p251_223|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p251_224|it's just a place to open it.
p251_225|friends of the earth scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p251_226|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p251_227|it s the real thing for sure.
p251_228|women were mostly notable by their absence.
p251_230|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p251_231|we played them off the pitch.
p251_232|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p251_233|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p251_234|i am immensely sad.
p251_235|i'd never seen a play about me.
p251_236|it is a gamble.
p251_237|but he failed to win the committee's support.
p251_238|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p251_239|we were awful.
p251_240|however no further action was taken by police.
p251_241|police later said the scheme would end in november.
p251_242|they had no children.
p251_243|it is set in paris.
p251_244|they should come forward.
p251_245|it's quite a line up
p251_246|i think a move would create a lot of interest.
p251_247|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p251_248|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p251_249|of further privacy he had no need.
p251_250|my future is in the marathon.
p251_251|the perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p251_252|we have a free vote on these things in our party.
p251_253|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p251_254|the court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p251_255|it is hard won.
p251_256|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p251_257|chambers said he would accept the place.
p251_258|manager bobby williamson has no injury worries.
p251_259|they tried to give her advice.
p251_260|his body was never found.
p251_262|he's a lovely young man.
p251_263|it was a hit.
p251_264|we are ready.
p251_265|they know no other way.
p251_266|i've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p251_267|we run within the law.
p251_268|they are interior designers and architects.
p251_269|kirkwood was arrested.
p251_270|they fail to engage.
p251_271|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p251_272|so in a sense it was a government subsidy.
p251_273|i was happily surprised.
p251_274|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p251_275|i am very angry.
p251_276|today we can say that a new era has begun.
p251_278|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p251_279|rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
p251_280|he thought he had a month to cross the street.
p251_281|their findings are published in the journal injury prevention.
p251_282|that's the only thing i will say.
p251_283|that decision is for the british parliament and people.
p251_284|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p251_285|the government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p251_286|he has not created a festival resource.
p251_287|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p251_288|our dispute is with the company not the travelling public.
p251_289|we do not want any terrorist attacks on any israeli civilians.
p251_290|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p251_291|we're in shock.
p251_292|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p251_293|one knows the feeling.
p251_294|things can change.
p251_295|it's a way of life.
p251_296|a search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p251_297|i am an estate agent.
p251_298|people have no choice.
p251_299|she looked so young.
p251_300|it was not hard to feel some sympathy for baxter yesterday.
p251_301|gerhard schroeder was the victor.
p251_302|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p251_303|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p251_304|you've got to have both sides.
p251_305|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p251_306|who will perform?
p251_307|this is a national crisis.
p251_308|scotland were beaten again.
p251_309|who did the recruiting?
p251_310|she said she could not believe that they had run away.
p251_311|for the moment our position remains the same.
p251_312|the results are sometimes contentious.
p251_313|these figures are truly awful.
p251_314|but it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p251_315|a new school will be built.
p251_316|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p251_317|we have to sort it out ourselves.
p251_318|he said she was mad.
p251_319|he was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p251_320|our task is to complete the picture.
p251_321|details of the new vessel were given in london yesterday.
p251_322|we are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p251_323|it wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p251_324|you are the glory.
p251_325|the letters are going out today.
p251_326|in fact they have the opposite effect.
p251_327|we are a peaceful people.
p251_328|ms anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p251_329|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p251_330|it is out there.
p251_331|they had a confession.
p251_332|however the groups denied the claims.
p251_333|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p251_334|that's the law of the land.
p251_335|there was no time scale.
p251_336|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p251_337|it's not long enough.
p251_338|i am so upset.
p251_339|he was not a big name.
p251_340|the police have to act to help them.
p251_341|it could have gone either way.
p251_342|is that an issue?
p251_343|he can do no wrong.
p251_344|finally he paid for the movie.
p251_345|you can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p251_346|in scotland we keep the faith.
p251_347|the team for the first game could be this one.
p251_348|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p251_349|the commitment was not long and it was worth the risk.
p251_350|he did a good job.
p251_351|we haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p251_352|well it won't.
p251_353|but the disease has not been confined to the tory party.
p251_355|i'm very lucky.
p251_356|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p251_357|the composer will conduct.
p251_359|it is not like working for a living.
p251_360|they got upset.
p251_361|i saw some good things.
p251_362|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p251_364|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p251_365|the scottish parliament should set an example for westminster to follow.
p251_366|however it was well worth the wait.
p251_367|he has seen the past.
p251_368|we will be homeless.
p251_369|that would help.
p251_372|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p251_373|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p251_374|his legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p252_001|please call stella.
p252_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p252_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p252_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p252_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p252_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p252_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p252_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p252_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p252_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p252_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p252_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p252_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p252_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p252_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p252_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p252_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p252_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p252_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p252_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p252_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
p252_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super position of a number of bows.
p252_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p252_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p252_025|then nine minutes before half time kenny miller struck.
p252_026|this would include insurance.
p252_027|it would fit very well with us.
p252_028|he does not even trust his own members.
p252_029|do not give your details to anyone.
p252_030|schools do not create that.
p252_032|the key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p252_033|just look at his fashion sense.
p252_034|i have every confidence.
p252_035|he added that her comments were noted.
p252_036|we've got a real battle now with richard.
p252_037|instead we make the ground pay.
p252_038|that time may never be broken.
p252_039|everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p252_040|he too started on the subs seats.
p252_041|i'm so happy that she did.
p252_042|we took part in a festival called global dance.
p252_043|this operation will change her life.
p252_044|something old something new as it were.
p252_045|the youngsters have put us in a strong position.
p252_046|they seem too much of a sure thing.
p252_047|that's what set him apart.
p252_048|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p252_050|the head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p252_051|she continued to enjoy sport.
p252_052|downing street also rejected the calls for a european army.
p252_053|by all accounts he was delighted.
p252_054|schools will not want change.
p252_055|i think i'm a bit too young.
p252_056|he was failed by his health authority.
p252_057|we wish to win but not at any price.
p252_058|i agree with you about this.
p252_059|or so he thought.
p252_060|must be prepared to use it.
p252_061|the fifth was found later.
p252_062|for a decade she was proved right.
p252_063|it was dangerous but vital employment.
p252_064|our people are ready.
p252_065|these figures cover the major british banking groups.
p252_066|probably he wasn't thinking at all.
p252_067|some of their players seemed almost dead.
p252_068|people come to see the highlands.
p252_069|it would have to be.
p252_071|this is a great opportunity for us.
p252_072|that is not possible.
p252_073|none has ever been found.
p252_074|insurance will perhaps reduce.
p252_075|their time has gone.
p252_076|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p252_077|how are you sir ?
p252_078|so is that it then ?
p252_079|do i have a favourite ?
p252_080|what do we do ?
p252_081|why do it otherwise ?
p252_082|what kind of a man does that mr dick ?
p252_083|celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p252_084|he has a real potential.
p252_085|let there be light.
p252_086|i can't remember a lot about the accident.
p252_087|scotland has great assets.
p252_088|that remains the same.
p252_089|it was exactly four months away.
p252_090|there is no issue of national security involved here.
p252_091|earlier both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p252_092|put simply it goes something like this.
p252_093|even if he doesn't have any lines.
p252_094|the car driver died.
p252_095|it looks that way.
p252_096|now comes the hard part.
p252_097|we are already seeing some positive results.
p252_098|we're at home which is important.
p252_099|they prepared some food very quickly.
p252_100|the circumstances have changed since last year.
p252_101|in his new cabinet role as party chairman it will become his primary task.
p252_102|they had three children.
p252_103|some young girls also came by last night.
p252_104|the idea is the shop within a shop.
p252_105|it would be easy to think so.
p252_106|and so it went on.
p252_108|scotland were on saturday.
p252_109|we want the results as soon as possible before thursday.
p252_110|he gets his moment.
p252_111|the newspapers by contrast had held their value.
p252_112|there was no reason.
p252_113|it gets too much.
p252_114|so they should be.
p252_115|no progress has been made.
p252_116|they need the money.
p252_117|that is the only way to rate players.
p252_118|now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p252_119|its failure is no surprise.
p252_120|no country has a similar training programme.
p252_121|her research is the second piece by edinburgh university scientists highlighted recently.
p252_122|consumers will also benefit.
p252_123|they pointed to the site.
p252_124|tony blair said as little.
p252_125|he is at peace with himself.
p252_126|gold admitted as much.
p252_127|it seemed like four hours.
p252_128|evidence must not be held back.
p252_129|we beat the welsh team.
p252_130|i saw a lot of good things against livingston.
p252_131|britain's role was to stop it.
p252_132|the allegations were still under investigation he added.
p252_133|eight others have followed.
p252_134|we're currently looking at the level of support.
p252_135|look george w bush will come here in two months.
p252_136|strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
p252_137|it's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p252_138|no contact was made although the arm was clearly raised.
p252_139|it should have its own network.
p252_140|as our national coach brown is done for.
p252_141|but this wasn't the full picture.
p252_142|that shows the impact it had.
p252_143|domestic orders have also fallen since january.
p252_144|i'd always wanted to act.
p252_145|we hope he will do until he finally does the double.
p252_146|that is a big risk at any price.
p252_147|i am never fully fit.
p252_148|are you going to win ?
p252_149|was it the wife ?
p252_150|why change it ?
p252_151|what do we want to do that for ?
p252_152|does the name matter ?
p252_153|how do you get it back ?
p252_154|what are you not good at ?
p252_155|i think therefore i am ?
p252_156|who was she ?
p252_157|he said some things which were better left alone.
p252_158|he nearly killed my son.
p252_160|finally we decided to put the whole speech in.
p252_161|i told them during their morning break.
p252_162|parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
p252_163|mr dewar understood that.
p252_164|nato has left them with no other option.
p252_165|they have shown great character.
p252_166|i am secure in my own position.
p252_167|it wasn't a pretty match.
p252_168|health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
p252_169|traffic was also heavy around strathclyde park.
p252_170|the second failed completely.
p252_171|that apart though i feel good.
p252_172|we have come a long way since then.
p252_173|sport is good for you.
p252_174|it was clearly not a battle.
p252_175|i made my mind up before we came on tour.
p252_176|you are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
p252_177|i'd rather be in our position than rangers.
p252_178|all options are available.
p252_179|i knew donald dewar.
p252_181|parents do not know very much about drugs.
p252_182|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p252_183|i've no idea how it works.
p252_184|it is actually building on the existing business.
p252_185|maybe this battle had been.
p252_186|art can challenge our value system.
p252_187|it involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p252_188|london remained the favourite.
p252_189|i've never had a year like this.
p252_190|he is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p252_191|she really suffered for her art.
p252_193|we knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p252_194|a child is not a product.
p252_195|which can happen any time.
p252_196|scottish life was there over one year.
p252_197|now he is back on top again.
p252_198|the hotel was huge.
p252_199|and they were being paid ?
p252_200|was everything done to save people ?
p252_201|what was the matter for concern ?
p252_202|do i think about them often ?
p252_203|is it in the right place ?
p252_204|scotland will not vote for new labour next time.
p252_205|this should begin in october.
p252_206|there remains some scottish influence however.
p252_207|my targets for the scottish conservative party are high.
p252_208|the role was perfect for russell.
p252_209|the price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
p252_210|if not a deal could take many months.
p252_211|their bodies were never found.
p252_212|it plans to return to this field.
p252_213|business will continue as usual.
p252_214|i want a free vote.
p252_215|fine said the press officer.
p252_216|the questions came quick and fast.
p252_217|the boys can speak about little else.
p252_218|her experience is certainly limited.
p252_219|we tried four banks.
p252_220|there is no doubt there's room for us.
p252_221|the labour side had developed in the north area.
p252_222|good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
p252_223|brian was last to join.
p252_224|he has many offers from the english premiership.
p252_225|now the door has opened.
p252_226|i'd rather play well next week than here.
p252_227|her death is a huge blow.
p252_228|the global market was about flat.
p252_229|three hit the target.
p252_230|the idea is simple.
p252_231|despite his success things began to fall apart.
p252_232|it's used by ayr technical college.
p252_233|the queen was on the ball yesterday but off the euro.
p252_234|we know the problems.
p252_235|britain will be little affected.
p252_236|there is a good reason for this.
p252_237|you know the type.
p252_238|the full cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p252_239|the board do not own the company.
p252_240|that time is not far away.
p252_241|that's been the difference between the sides.
p252_242|when i was training.
p252_243|i did let myself down a bit.
p252_244|one letter from a teacher arrived at christmas.
p252_245|this is absolutely not true.
p252_246|wall street provided the british market with little fresh direction.
p252_247|it was a great evening.
p252_248|we have several options.
p252_250|our focus remains on quality revenue.
p252_251|perhaps it will happen again.
p252_252|the question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p252_253|it is based on population rather than need.
p252_254|we were leading by two goals.
p252_255|it had happened on average once a week this year.
p252_256|it is very much in the eye of the individual.
p252_258|it was an accident.
p252_260|my goals have never changed.
p252_262|so we kept them waiting.
p252_263|he makes time for everyone.
p252_264|that's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p252_265|the proposal was rejected.
p252_266|look at a computer.
p252_267|he did better then.
p252_268|but the next day she paid for it.
p252_269|we still think this trade is on the increase.
p252_270|it is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
p252_271|this was the perfect setting.
p252_273|the selection will be made by the international olympic committee next year.
p252_274|the long term trend is equally clear.
p252_275|i see no reason to doubt that the situation in scotland is any different.
p252_276|all films open tomorrow
p252_277|if i didn't go for the world record i'd feel guilty.
p252_278|paul never gave up hope.
p252_279|those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
p252_280|they bought the property four years ago.
p252_281|i hope numbers will be up on last time.
p252_282|their only score of the half came from a penalty by jones.
p252_283|it is a dangerous sport.
p252_284|oil stocks also provided a boost.
p252_286|the future might well be green after all.
p252_287|they were seriously after him.
p252_288|it was a bit like having children.
p252_289|aberdeen had little to offer.
p252_290|donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
p252_291|i'm interested in interesting work.
p252_292|his season started this afternoon.
p252_293|he is a good signing for rangers.
p252_294|white would like to buy further bus businesses.
p252_295|kenny and i are ready.
p252_296|friday night was a pretty good night.
p252_297|he also worked on general building contracts in the area.
p252_298|they have played their part.
p252_299|he followed the italian route.
p252_300|stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
p252_301|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p252_302|so does every industry.
p252_303|tomorrow will be my last.
p252_304|but there's also a love for the songs.
p252_305|his career may also provide food for thought for ferguson.
p252_306|we must move on.
p252_307|it's just an area of water.
p252_308|we have achieved that.
p252_309|their eyes however told a different story.
p252_310|good players have become bad.
p252_311|many events are down on numbers.
p252_312|he had served his time.
p252_313|it was a total surprise.
p252_314|if a service doesn't pay it will go.
p252_315|the process will start tomorrow.
p252_316|motherwell took them from half chances.
p252_317|that wasn't an outstanding performance from celtic.
p252_319|one finding emerged clearly.
p252_320|there was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p252_321|we lost to a poor team.
p252_322|we are keen to see truth and justice.
p252_323|we have clearly become well established.
p252_324|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p252_325|murray plays down return
p252_326|other teams moved up too.
p252_327|not one person spoke badly.
p252_328|we were caught out.
p252_329|the performance continues to improve.
p252_330|we want immediate action.
p252_331|our relationship has been very good.
p252_332|someone should tell them.
p252_333|but it won't help british farmers.
p252_334|does that put pressure on us ?
p252_335|did it work ?
p252_336|do you think we are a top nation ?
p252_337|is our children learning ?
p252_338|how independent is that ?
p252_339|because i think it's there.
p252_340|if we get the wrong candidate.
p252_341|they emerged before the patients left hospital.
p252_342|they will now remain split up.
p252_343|we are a husband and wife team.
p252_344|it was the september weekend after all.
p252_345|he would add value.
p252_346|sources yesterday said the royal bank has declined to back him.
p252_347|those overseas offices were great.
p252_348|that was our last chance to do something.
p252_349|maybe she is right.
p252_350|i saw one man vote five times.
p252_351|no plans for projects are yet in place.
p252_352|no sport needs that sort of thing.
p252_353|the senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
p252_354|any increase always has some effect.
p252_355|what form did that take ?
p252_356|are they free ?
p252_357|what are they for ?
p252_358|is there a waiting list ?
p252_359|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p252_360|they had better be.
p252_361|employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p252_362|he was a great human being.
p252_363|that seems highly unlikely.
p252_364|still i am delighted.
p252_365|analysts welcomed the news.
p252_366|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p252_367|you will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
p252_368|they made such decisions in london.
p252_369|results of the survey are expected by the end of june.
p252_370|the whole system is too complex.
p252_371|he said legal action could be considered.
p252_372|the european elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p252_373|this is far too high.
p252_374|these matters can't just be medical decisions.
p252_375|if you believe in the blue and white.
p252_376|we have no information on iraq.
p252_378|the referee faces a massive job.
p252_379|that could be ready within another nine months.
p252_380|next league matches kilmarnock.
p252_381|an appeal was unlikely.
p252_382|he said he had now written to scottish industry minister lord macdonald.
p252_383|i got dropped for that game.
p252_384|no real attempt was made to get orders.
p252_385|tourism is a vital industry for scotland.
p252_386|this year i understood.
p252_387|it's clearly a budget.
p252_388|it's an option but i can't really comment.
p252_389|the women are victims here.
p252_390|i'm not sure that's right.
p252_391|i've kept him in touch with everything.
p252_392|the property is owned by glasgow city council.
p252_393|there's nothing natural left.
p252_394|he could still be president.
p252_395|there's always a case.
p252_396|the new manager must make tough decisions.
p252_397|he has worked hard over the years.
p252_399|it was too difficult.
p252_400|we will miss him against celtic.
p252_401|i managed to do that.
p252_402|so what happens next ?
p252_403|had this been common practice ?
p252_404|what do they want us to do ?
p252_405|is it worth it ?
p252_406|does it matter ?
p252_407|the doctors are quite positive about my progress.
p252_408|they had to have hospital treatment.
p252_409|five local people were injured.
p252_410|all the dead were believed to have been french.
p252_411|i'd like to report a murder.
p253_001|please call stella.
p253_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p253_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p253_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p253_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p253_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p253_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p253_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p253_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p253_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p253_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.

p253_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p253_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p253_025|but it failed.
p253_026|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p253_027|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p253_028|however the following year the cancer returned.
p253_029|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p253_030|this is the window.
p253_031|he was jailed for five years.
p253_032|help is needed.
p253_033|then suddenly they weren't.
p253_034|it is marvellous.
p253_035|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p253_036|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p253_037|they're just different.
p253_038|it was clear.
p253_039|indeed he does.
p253_040|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p253_041|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p253_042|dancing was her life.
p253_043|the ambition this year is to improve on last.
p253_044|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.

p253_046|it's the only thing.
p253_047|you had better believe it.
p253_048|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p253_049|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p253_050|a neighbour said.
p253_051|it is bizarre.
p253_052|there is no reason at all.
p253_053|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p253_054|every aspect of our play was first class.
p253_055|our people are ready.
p253_056|here's a clue.
p253_057|i was lost.
p253_058|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p253_059|my fitness was very poor.
p253_060|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p253_061|it is unique.
p253_062|i expect a rapid response.
p253_063|it happened so quickly.
p253_064|that's the truth.
p253_065|it seems to have worked.
p253_066|this is the first step.
p253_067|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p253_068|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p253_069|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p253_071|sounds like the sixth sense?
p253_072|robin williams is very subdued.
p253_073|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p253_074|it could take some time.
p253_075|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p253_076|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p253_077|it is a job creation scheme.
p253_078|the party is up for it.
p253_079|people must remain vigilant.
p253_080|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p253_081|what has changed?
p253_082|i will miss him.
p253_083|he is in the queue.
p253_084|i first met him last summer.
p253_085|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p253_086|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p253_087|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p253_088|they lived for their children.
p253_089|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p253_090|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p253_091|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p253_092|we are on the path of change.
p253_093|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p253_095|yet it worked.
p253_096|he's been hit by it.
p253_097|i love the dome.
p253_098|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p253_099|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p253_100|it is a love affair.
p253_101|tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on europe.
p253_102|they make a selective perception process.
p253_103|two of the team became ill.
p253_104|that would be unlawful.
p253_106|oil embargo endorsed.
p253_107|it was an adventure.
p253_108|health secretary frank dobson made the surprise announcement in the commons yesterday.
p253_109|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p253_110|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p253_111|i was fighting for my life i thought.
p253_112|is that right?
p253_113|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p253_114|it's a shame.
p253_115|it was the eighties.
p253_116|it is so sad.
p253_117|tony blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from dublin.
p253_118|the mood is upbeat.
p253_119|it is rubbish.
p253_120|who would be a referee?
p253_121|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p253_122|we enjoyed it today.
p253_123|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p253_124|here again they were denied a voice.
p253_125|there were no grounds for his action.
p253_126|i'm so angry.
p253_127|she really suffered for her art.
p253_128|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p253_129|it's not a u turn.
p253_130|no production was achieved.
p253_131|i am now unemployed.
p253_132|we had a great time when we came with easy rider.
p253_133|it plans to return to this field.
p253_134|we work well together.
p253_135|the judges will give a ruling next wednesday.
p253_136|we are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p253_138|i was dead.
p253_139|i don't know the full story.
p253_140|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p253_141|she died at her home.
p253_142|he realises his mistake.
p253_143|he felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p253_144|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p253_145|i was awful.
p253_146|who would have?
p253_147|he sets the nature of his parliament in a simple realistic context.
p253_148|it is not just about pay.
p253_149|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p253_150|there was a substantial explosion.
p253_151|i was stunned.
p253_152|the woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p253_153|the weather forecast isn't good.
p253_154|they have not been named.
p253_156|my dad is a hero.
p253_157|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p253_158|words were not required.
p253_160|life becomes a song.
p253_161|well he should know.
p253_162|was this element always there?
p253_163|these days are long gone.
p253_164|i'd love to be like peter.
p253_165|i've put my own money into this project.
p253_167|military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p253_168|i was in the train station overnight.
p253_169|we have a budget in march.
p253_170|we should do everything at a stroke.
p253_171|you had to go and see him.
p253_173|in a way he was.
p253_175|blair's response was weak.
p253_176|as we worked.
p253_177|we are the gateway to justice.
p253_178|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p253_179|the goals were good.
p253_180|within months he was a part time tribunal chairman.
p253_181|it's an idea.
p253_182|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p253_183|they need to look after themselves.
p253_184|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p253_185|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p253_186|does this matter?
p253_187|our team is just so young.
p253_188|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p253_189|however he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p253_190|it caused a lot of upset.
p253_191|but a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p253_192|we speak about the performance.
p253_194|peace was won.
p253_195|it's a fact.
p253_196|i came home by ambulance.
p253_197|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p253_198|is that success?
p253_199|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p253_200|who will pay for this?
p253_201|it's all about money money money.
p253_202|sadly it can't.
p253_203|it was worth a photograph.
p253_205|we have an election in eight days.
p253_206|feel the heat?
p253_207|the proposals are to be debated on monday by city councillors.
p253_208|twaddle is a case in point.
p253_209|it had all been arranged.
p253_211|work has started.
p253_212|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p253_213|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p253_214|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p253_215|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p253_216|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p253_217|then another one came.
p253_218|the loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p253_219|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p253_220|clearly the stakes are high.
p253_221|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p253_222|i'd never seen a play about me.
p253_223|it's not before time.
p253_224|i didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p253_225|i am very sorry that alastair campbell has taken this decision.
p253_226|i would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p253_227|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p253_228|my wife and family are the support system.
p253_229|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p253_230|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p253_231|we are so proud.
p253_232|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p253_233|of course i was tempted.
p253_234|it's quite a line up
p253_235|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p253_236|the minister is the engineer.
p253_237|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p253_238|it is hard won.
p253_239|our policy is clear.
p253_240|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p253_241|the scene is about this?
p253_242|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p253_243|my son was too young to die.
p253_244|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p253_245|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p253_247|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p253_248|that could be in place by next year.
p253_249|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p253_250|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p253_251|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p253_252|they fail to engage.
p253_253|it will now relate to all public bodies in scotland.
p253_254|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p253_255|they must play for each other.
p253_256|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p253_257|there's not much money in cycling.
p253_258|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p253_260|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p253_261|he has not created a festival resource.
p253_262|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p253_263|he was also married with two children.
p253_264|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p253_265|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p253_266|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p253_267|one knows the feeling.
p253_268|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p253_269|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p253_270|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p253_271|she failed in her action.
p253_272|he promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p253_273|she looked so young.
p253_274|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p253_275|it's so awful.
p253_276|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p253_277|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p253_278|you've got to have both sides.
p253_279|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p253_280|dialogue is the key.
p253_281|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p253_282|she is an expert on medical ethics.
p253_283|who will perform?
p253_285|who did the recruiting?
p253_287|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p253_288|i was the sheep.
p253_289|i was brought up in a mining background.
p253_290|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p253_291|nothing is safe.
p253_292|but it's a subtle process.
p253_293|one was a lawyer.
p253_294|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p253_296|they are wrong.
p253_297|eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p253_298|there were no passengers on board.
p253_299|it could work.
p253_300|this is a war over our home.
p253_301|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p253_302|there's no evidence he was ever there.
p253_303|you should be.
p253_304|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p253_305|the letters are going out today.
p253_307|the premier league has been a huge success.
p253_308|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p253_309|she is very distinctive.
p253_310|we have got to get the points from this one.
p253_311|you may have a short memory.
p253_313|we are in the end game.
p253_314|it will work.
p253_316|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p253_317|our message was inclusive.
p253_318|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p253_319|feel the air the space.
p253_320|is there a new way forward?
p253_322|the figures are bad but not that bad.
p253_323|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p253_324|however they will only be found in the wild.
p253_326|three years ago he would have been.
p253_327|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p253_328|locally too the mp is under fire.
p253_329|two people were interviewed.
p253_330|i've got no secret.
p253_331|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p253_332|this is a friendly match?
p253_333|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p253_334|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p253_335|they should take their mobile phones.
p253_336|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p253_337|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p253_338|another case of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in scotland yesterday.
p253_339|she is free.
p253_340|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p253_341|tyson is overwhelmed.
p253_342|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p253_343|yet he left a few days later.
p253_344|it was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p253_345|as indeed they would be.
p253_346|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p253_348|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p253_349|the shareholders will vote to wind up the company on friday morning.
p253_350|that would help.
p253_351|my husband was angry.
p253_352|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p253_354|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p253_355|this is a club on the rise.
p253_356|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p253_357|their time has gone.
p253_358|he could make it.
p253_359|the death rates are still as high.
p253_360|now though he has an incentive.
p253_361|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p253_363|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p253_364|it is a simple equation.
p253_365|by that time however it was already too late.
p253_366|it was a funny game.
p253_367|there wasn't a goal.
p253_368|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p253_369|colour was at the core of his life.
p253_371|i'm still an amateur in that sense.
p253_372|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p253_373|something is wrong.
p253_374|of course we will need to strengthen the squad for europe.
p253_375|that's the name of the game though.
p253_376|since then he has played no active part in the company.
p253_377|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p253_378|does that put pressure on us?
p253_379|at the last i found a bunker.
p253_380|yet the data is compelling.
p253_381|it's a real problem.
p253_382|it's just outrageous.
p253_383|he also insisted that no concessions had been made to the french.
p253_384|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p253_385|well it did last time he was reminded.
p253_386|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p253_387|they are good.
p253_388|i'm glad i came.
p253_390|i've had my time.
p253_391|it will take place in july.
p253_392|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p253_394|but in fact the reverse is true.
p253_397|what would be the point?
p253_399|it might be.
p253_400|the weekly average was three hours.
p253_401|relief was beyond belief.
p253_402|he got his degree.
p253_403|went on sale.
p253_404|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p253_405|until they came to do it.
p253_407|that may be.
p253_408|it is legally binding.
p253_409|we went straight into the bedroom.
p253_410|is there any prospect of this happening?
p254_001|please call stella.
p254_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p254_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p254_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p254_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p254_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p254_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p254_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p254_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p254_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p254_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p254_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p254_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p254_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p254_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p254_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p254_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p254_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p254_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p254_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p254_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p254_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p254_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p254_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p254_025|johnson was pretty low.
p254_026|but it failed.
p254_027|they may be wrong.
p254_028|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p254_029|they should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p254_030|the appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p254_031|suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p254_032|so if we can take anything from tonight it will be fantastic.
p254_033|it's a matter of balance.
p254_034|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p254_035|then suddenly they weren't.
p254_037|they have now been banned from celtic park for life.
p254_038|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p254_039|they're just different.
p254_040|it was clear.
p254_041|it is not for any other purpose.
p254_042|the main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p254_043|i was scared.
p254_044|however the decision has been welcomed by scottish enterprise officials.
p254_045|no meaningful response was issued.
p254_046|that period was a struggle.
p254_047|i am just going to go for it.
p254_048|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p254_049|this represents a tough game for us.
p254_050|it's a crucial award.
p254_051|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p254_052|that should do it.
p254_053|it's a blessing.
p254_054|is a drug dealer?
p254_055|but it might have done.
p254_056|that time has passed.
p254_057|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p254_058|he is too weak to move.
p254_059|life is good.
p254_060|it is the whole package.
p254_061|this is a club on the rise.
p254_062|he had no enemies.
p254_063|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p254_064|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p254_065|that's the day job.
p254_066|in the current outbreak the reverse is true.
p254_067|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p254_068|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p254_069|my mother is a widow.
p254_070|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p254_071|jobs could go.
p254_072|four other charges were dropped.
p254_073|they're appalled by that.
p254_074|there was a battle there.
p254_075|it's good news and long overdue.
p254_076|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p254_077|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p254_078|they never gave up hope.
p254_079|it came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p254_080|painful but only because it's true.
p254_081|it's all i can do.
p254_082|the company yesterday refused to comment.
p254_083|both sides have been hit by injury.
p254_084|the price cuts are really exciting.

p254_087|there was an e mail.
p254_088|even the one she loved.
p254_090|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p254_091|it may well have been.
p254_092|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p254_093|he liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p254_094|last week he was taken into hospital.
p254_095|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p254_096|all options are open.
p254_097|you will be.
p254_098|global scotland will be held at the glasgow royal concert hall.
p254_099|and rugby fans can help.
p254_100|now the system is right behind us.
p254_101|however it did not end that way.
p254_102|this reason is to do with the nature of the scotland manager.
p254_103|the group is due to report by the end of the year.
p254_104|i love the dome.
p254_105|scotland will have strong defences as part of the united kingdom.
p254_106|the selection process is still at a very early stage.
p254_107|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p254_108|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p254_109|but it was a pleasure.
p254_110|he takes the job.
p254_111|it was an adventure.
p254_112|that all hope is never lost.
p254_113|and i thought we have to do something with this.
p254_114|it was really enjoyable on saturday.
p254_115|it is normal.
p254_116|i was fighting for my life i thought.
p254_117|we need to handle it.
p254_118|tony blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from dublin.
p254_119|it's a long process.
p254_120|they were behind the wheel.
p254_121|the fire was above the hole.
p254_122|this is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p254_123|we are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p254_124|mr chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p254_125|i could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p254_126|i joined a group.
p254_127|does this mean.
p254_128|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p254_129|it is a job creation scheme.
p254_130|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p254_131|i'm so angry.
p254_132|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p254_133|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p254_134|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p254_135|it's terrible that he has died the same way.
p254_136|the whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p254_137|it plans to return to this field.

p254_141|mr hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p254_143|i was the last man to touch the ball.
p254_144|three penalties were given.
p254_145|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p254_146|he is severe.
p254_147|it is difficult for ali.
p254_148|there is a lack of chemistry.
p254_149|this is the way things should be handled.
p254_150|he felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p254_151|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p254_152|it is not just about pay.
p254_153|labour's scottish general secretary alex rowley was delighted yesterday.
p254_154|you know the type.
p254_155|the weaknesses are few.
p254_156|the woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p254_157|i was in daily contact.
p254_158|we will turn the corner.
p254_159|this latter point is hugely important.
p254_160|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p254_161|it has been a lovely family occasion.
p254_162|he's a nice guy.
p254_163|it has to be now.
p254_164|they are not advertised.
p254_165|i have got a wife to feed.
p254_166|tell it like it was?
p254_167|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p254_168|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p254_169|we started to struggle with each other towards the end.
p254_170|last weekend in germany he missed the cut.
p254_171|he was a crazy man.
p254_172|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p254_173|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p254_174|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p254_175|it was a great achievement to win at wembley.
p254_176|it is not either national standards or local control.
p254_177|the clarity is vital.
p254_178|the hotel was now for sale.
p254_179|tony had arrived.
p254_180|he will need that machine.
p254_181|i was totally wrong.
p254_182|we did everything by the book.
p254_183|we talk about mr michael johnson and he is awesome.

p254_185|i grew up listening to these people.
p254_186|the spokeswoman said the flat in london was very small.
p254_187|peace was won.
p254_188|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p254_189|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p254_190|off i went.
p254_191|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p254_192|is that it?
p254_193|the conference is the first test.
p254_194|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p254_195|the sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p254_196|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p254_197|they've got three quarters of the way.
p254_198|the album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p254_199|today was first class.
p254_200|we will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p254_201|we have an election in eight days.
p254_202|it's like a garage.
p254_203|but i am a worried man.
p254_204|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p254_205|that is an important part of our role.
p254_206|it is a small part and it's very small in the book.
p254_207|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p254_208|i began to pray.
p254_209|a grampian police spokesman said.
p254_210|his third goal was superb.
p254_211|it's not ideal.
p254_212|the fbi could become involved.
p254_213|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p254_214|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p254_215|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p254_216|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p254_217|you have to do your research.
p254_218|saturday is gone.
p254_219|we played them off the pitch.
p254_220|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p254_221|clearly the stakes are high.
p254_222|the boy is no longer with us.
p254_223|the track is currently covered in snow.
p254_224|they are the innocent victims.
p254_225|it's so special.
p254_226|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p254_227|at the time he was a living legend.
p254_228|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p254_229|gerhard schroeder was the victor.
p254_230|they tried to give her advice.
p254_231|and thought we would get away with it.
p254_232|we were a load of rubbish.
p254_233|they should come forward.
p254_234|it is not the message alone.
p254_235|he will make a statement on the dispute in the commons tomorrow.
p254_236|the singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p254_237|it's a lovely lovely film.
p254_238|but it's a subtle process.
p254_239|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p254_240|my future is in the marathon.
p254_241|they are all bright and different.
p254_242|chambers said he would accept the place.
p254_243|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p254_244|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p254_245|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p254_246|he got the same story.
p254_247|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p254_248|i was shocked.
p254_249|he's a lovely young man.
p254_250|there's the mix.
p254_251|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p254_252|this year i understood.
p254_253|that could be in place by next year.
p254_254|i was never going to play against scotland.
p254_255|it's a source of deep concern.
p254_256|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p254_257|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p254_258|the pensioners did not want to know.
p254_259|it is also very valuable.
p254_260|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p254_261|the work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p254_262|he thought he had a month to cross the street.
p254_263|that decision is for the british parliament and people.
p254_264|they want to shut the scottish office.
p254_265|there is no link.
p254_266|this is a question of islam.
p254_267|the government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p254_268|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p254_269|our dispute is with the company not the travelling public.
p254_270|it was an easy decision to come here.
p254_271|we do not want any terrorist attacks on any israeli civilians.
p254_272|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p254_273|everything will fall into place it should be fine.
p254_275|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p254_276|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p254_277|it's a way of life.
p254_278|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p254_279|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p254_280|people have no choice.
p254_281|if not he should go home.
p254_282|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p254_283|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p254_284|you can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p254_285|i saw it at a ruck.
p254_286|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p254_287|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p254_288|he will address the nation this evening.
p254_289|the mood is good.
p254_290|it's like a high school play.
p254_291|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p254_292|this is a national crisis.
p254_293|well he can do it.
p254_294|these figures are truly awful.
p254_295|that could change.
p254_296|who can predict?
p254_297|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p254_298|one was a lawyer.
p254_299|it is a road of death.
p254_300|the plot is minimal.
p254_301|the court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p254_302|i did not name it.
p254_303|we have waited a long time for this.
p254_304|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p254_305|they were fantastic.
p254_306|we are a peaceful people.
p254_307|craig is a major concern for us.
p254_308|the problems began a long time ago.
p254_309|my body is clearly capable.
p254_310|it is out there.
p254_311|he said she was mad.
p254_312|in the old days it was easy.
p254_313|we are in the end game.
p254_314|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p254_315|it is a strong case.
p254_316|the parents will have a great time too.
p254_317|donald was his friend.
p254_318|he was not a big name.
p254_319|the police have to act to help them.
p254_320|it was no secret that i wanted to sign him.
p254_321|the boat was fantastic.
p254_322|it's not long enough.
p254_323|my first concern is for the safety of the public.
p254_324|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p254_326|finally he paid for the movie.
p254_327|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p254_329|it would appear that it has not been a problem.
p254_330|they haven't got a hope.
p254_331|it has moved on in the last week.
p254_332|i'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p254_333|today she has been released.
p254_334|the announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p254_335|it should be a great game though.
p254_336|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p254_337|it should be scrapped.
p254_338|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p254_339|it was good for us that they lost that day.
p254_340|they should take their mobile phones.
p254_341|it is not like working for a living.
p254_342|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p254_343|it is long gone.
p254_344|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p254_345|tell us about it.
p254_346|it's all going to clear the debt.
p254_347|that is a break with tradition.
p254_348|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p254_349|it was very formal.
p254_350|i kept going for her.
p254_351|the scottish parliament should set an example for westminster to follow.
p254_352|but the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p254_353|no other job in world football can compare to this one.
p254_354|instead he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p254_355|we will be homeless.
p254_356|new zealand rugby is totally different.
p254_357|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p254_358|it is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p254_359|his legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p254_360|we have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p254_361|saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p254_362|the criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p254_363|there was no option.
p254_364|it's now down in black and white.
p254_365|now though he has an incentive.
p254_366|it seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p254_367|they received a reply from their own managers.
p254_368|but i managed.
p254_369|five members were disciplined.
p254_370|talks are progressing.
p254_371|they play together perfectly.
p254_372|yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p254_373|it's a record label not a form of music.
p254_374|it became a national network.
p254_375|it is a large number.
p254_376|we felt at the moment it was not possible.
p254_377|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p254_378|he has the edge.
p254_379|of course we will need to strengthen the squad for europe.
p254_380|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p254_381|face to face
p254_382|i am very happy with life.
p254_383|i'm just enjoying every match.
p254_384|the service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
p254_385|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p254_386|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p254_387|we have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p254_388|they really did a great job.
p254_389|at the last i found a bunker.
p254_390|yet the data is compelling.
p254_391|perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
p254_392|i would have loved to play in an old firm.
p254_393|i'm pleased about one thing.
p254_394|it is also claimed that he was murdered.
p254_395|apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p254_396|we're looking for justice.
p254_397|i can lead by example.
p254_398|eriksson would have approved.
p254_399|pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p254_400|it was a breathtaking moment.
p254_401|it really is a gift to the world.
p254_402|the car was just there.
p254_403|it was on fire.
p255_001|please call stella.
p255_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p255_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p255_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p255_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p255_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p255_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p255_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p255_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p255_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p255_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p255_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p255_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p255_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p255_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p255_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p255_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p255_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p255_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p255_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p255_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p255_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p255_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p255_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p255_025|he has not been named.
p255_026|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p255_027|they should be so lucky.
p255_028|we want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p255_029|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p255_030|life was like a timetable.
p255_031|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p255_032|then suddenly they weren't.
p255_033|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p255_034|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p255_035|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p255_036|we do not expect any surplus.
p255_037|dancing was her life.
p255_038|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p255_039|it is a memorial.
p255_040|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p255_041|but it might have done.
p255_042|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p255_043|people were determined to change the government in the last election.
p255_044|i felt really good until friday.
p255_045|she looked so young.
p255_046|life is good.
p255_047|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p255_048|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p255_049|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p255_050|it was not hard to feel some sympathy for baxter yesterday.
p255_051|mr blair is the problem in scotland not the solution.
p255_052|it's very odd.
p255_053|because we do not need it.
p255_054|that's the truth.
p255_055|my mother is a widow.
p255_057|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p255_058|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p255_059|equity declined to comment.
p255_060|hopefully we have learned a lot from that game.
p255_061|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p255_062|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p255_063|we should have known.
p255_064|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p255_065|the end result is precisely the same.
p255_066|it came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p255_067|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p255_068|there could be a way back.
p255_069|he highlighted a lack of staff.
p255_070|then followed a bout of flu.
p255_071|ferguson should take note.
p255_072|it works for us.
p255_073|he is now resident in england.
p255_074|i've got the shirt.
p255_075|two israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p255_076|what has changed?
p255_077|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p255_078|last week he was taken into hospital.
p255_079|he is driven.
p255_080|nothing is yet confirmed.
p255_081|we have other options.
p255_082|we want to know about the policy.
p255_083|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p255_084|it's never too late.
p255_085|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p255_086|we do not get that impression now.
p255_087|it is a lifeline.
p255_088|however it did not end that way.
p255_089|they've got to account for it.
p255_090|that deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p255_091|until you hit the big games.
p255_092|we could not get any possession.
p255_093|if you could find it.
p255_094|the selection process is still at a very early stage.
p255_095|it is a delight on every level.
p255_096|get to know him.
p255_097|may not have been at fault?
p255_098|i had a ball today.

p255_101|oil embargo endorsed.
p255_102|scotland were beaten again.
p255_103|before the game we went for a pint.
p255_104|further protests are likely.
p255_105|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p255_106|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p255_107|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p255_108|he was jailed for a year.
p255_109|i came to complete.
p255_110|naturally it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p255_111|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p255_112|maybe this battle has been.
p255_113|i'm delighted about that.
p255_114|until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p255_115|i joined a group.
p255_116|does this mean.
p255_117|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p255_118|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p255_119|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p255_120|an announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p255_121|i can't even get into the a team.
p255_122|wednesday night was a difficult time for britton.
p255_123|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p255_124|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p255_125|next season for every manager is a long time away.
p255_126|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p255_127|it will be too hot.
p255_128|the role was perfect for russell.
p255_129|if not a deal could take many months.
p255_130|my main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p255_131|our intentions are real.
p255_132|it is also well received.
p255_133|the scottish socialist party is also expected to attend.
p255_134|we never said that we would walk through the third division.
p255_135|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p255_136|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p255_137|i saw some terrible things.
p255_138|it's a question of fashion.
p255_139|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p255_140|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p255_141|we have got to get it right.
p255_142|wallace was a prisoner of war.
p255_143|the way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p255_144|who would be right?
p255_145|she died at her home.
p255_146|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p255_147|i was awful.
p255_148|the idea is simple.
p255_149|it is like a football team.
p255_150|it would be a last resort.
p255_151|he sets the nature of his parliament in simple realistic context.
p255_152|it is not just about pay.
p255_153|the home side didn't stand a chance.
p255_154|we shall not be moved.
p255_155|the weaknesses are few.
p255_156|the amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p255_157|crucially though united were still alive.
p255_158|the first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p255_159|there's a sense of excess in the novel.
p255_160|work has started.
p255_161|it's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p255_162|and sooner than we may think.
p255_163|the weather affected the other two games in fife.
p255_164|it is so unfair.
p255_165|i will tell you.
p255_166|eight months later he was dead.
p255_167|it could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p255_168|we have to move forward.
p255_169|however the french government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p255_170|i lost my head.
p255_171|that must be left to the parole board.
p255_172|he is keen to stay in public service.
p255_173|you are not going in blind.
p255_174|they will do their own thing.
p255_175|as far as we were concerned the deal with kennedy was dead.
p255_176|you had to go and see him.
p255_177|waiting times for these services are too long.
p255_178|a helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p255_179|his team management was protective.
p255_180|is saddam a threat?
p255_181|the jury is still out.
p255_182|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p255_183|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p255_184|and i saw the light
p255_185|the event was held in the council's headquarters in hamilton.
p255_186|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p255_187|tony had arrived.
p255_188|it is the whole package.
p255_189|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p255_190|the goals were good.
p255_191|there is no point in looking any further.
p255_192|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p255_193|four policemen were wounded.
p255_194|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p255_195|the award to senator mitchell was announced by the foreign office.
p255_196|they are now divorced.
p255_197|i cannot say too much about them.
p255_198|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p255_199|however this idea is never developed.
p255_200|it is a farce.
p255_201|i am totally surprised.
p255_202|we must keep our feet on the ground.
p255_203|however he said the money had not been wasted.
p255_204|the confidence is low but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p255_205|he has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p255_206|the sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p255_207|the album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p255_208|it's just awful.
p255_209|it's all about money money money.
p255_210|it was worth a photograph.
p255_211|we will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p255_212|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p255_213|we'll have to work hard today.
p255_214|he knows a lot.
p255_215|that is an important part of our role.
p255_216|her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p255_217|i had relied on him.
p255_218|i had decided to quit the show.
p255_219|his third goal was superb.
p255_220|it's been a good year.
p255_221|so far the scheme has not been used in scotland.
p255_222|it's not ideal.
p255_223|the fbi could become involved.
p255_224|a final decision will be taken by first minister donald dewar.
p255_225|the attacker has been put in foster care.
p255_226|his death was a tragic accident.
p255_227|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p255_228|but it was for charity just a bit of fun.
p255_229|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p255_230|during the communist time they were very privileged.
p255_231|mental health is a massive issue.
p255_232|we played them off the pitch.
p255_233|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p255_234|our numbers are small.
p255_235|they are the innocent victims.
p255_236|it's like a basketball.
p255_237|you should always be able to get out in some direction.
p255_238|at the time he was a living legend.
p255_239|it's the same as glasgow.
p255_240|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p255_241|it is mainstream.
p255_242|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p255_243|we were awful.
p255_244|they had no children.
p255_245|it is set in paris.
p255_246|it is not the message alone.
p255_247|it's quite a line up
p255_248|it has been declared.
p255_249|the perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p255_250|we have a free vote on these things in our party.
p255_251|it would appear that it has not been a problem.
p255_252|it's only fair.
p255_253|he repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p255_254|chambers said he would accept the place.
p255_255|his body was never found.
p255_256|there's the mix.
p255_257|we need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p255_258|i can't get a job.
p255_259|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p255_260|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p255_261|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p255_262|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p255_263|it will now relate to all public bodies in scotland.
p255_264|i am very angry.
p255_265|they must play for each other.
p255_266|he can do everything.
p255_267|an appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p255_268|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p255_269|the work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p255_270|he thought he had a month to cross the street.
p255_271|it's all change on the music scene in manchester.
p255_272|they want to shut the scottish office.
p255_273|this is a question of islam.
p255_274|it looks as though he will be right.
p255_275|he was popular.
p255_276|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p255_277|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p255_278|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p255_279|everything will fall into place it should be fine.
p255_280|one knows the feeling.
p255_281|he promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
p255_282|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p255_283|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p255_284|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p255_285|this is a national crisis.
p255_286|the death toll included five children.
p255_287|my body is clearly capable.
p255_288|so i did.
p255_289|the judges will give a ruling next wednesday.
p255_290|she said she could not believe that they had run away.
p255_292|these figures are truly awful.
p255_293|it's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p255_294|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p255_295|who can predict?
p255_296|if you can run a computer you can talk to the world.
p255_297|a new school will be built.
p255_298|i have tonight resigned as member of the european commission.
p255_299|last night he was due to hold talks with arafat.
p255_300|graeme was prepared.
p255_301|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p255_302|he was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p255_303|our task is to complete the picture.
p255_304|they fail to engage.
p255_305|details of the new vessel were given in london yesterday.
p255_306|the company yesterday refused to comment.
p255_307|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p255_308|it's certainly different.
p255_309|is there on his hands?
p255_310|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p255_311|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p255_312|there is no other solution to congestion in edinburgh.
p255_313|i never thought it would take this long.
p255_314|in fact they have the opposite effect.
p255_315|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p255_316|henman has been warned.
p255_317|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p255_318|i asked for a positive response and i was given one.
p255_319|for the moment our position remains the same.
p255_320|referees are easy targets.
p255_321|there was some merit in that.
p255_322|i came into this world with nothing.
p255_323|that's the law of the land.
p255_324|they will be destroyed.
p255_325|it is a strong case.
p255_326|my view has now completely changed.
p255_327|the police have to act to help them.
p255_328|we agreed to disagree.
p255_329|on thursday mr blair will address the institute of public policy research.
p255_330|it could have gone either way.
p255_331|it is a time bomb.
p255_332|i'd like to take the plunge.
p255_333|it can be halted.
p255_334|work is under way to create a studio in inverness.
p255_335|they haven't got a hope.
p255_336|gaelic provision continued to be good.
p255_337|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p255_338|the scottish prison service said it could not comment on the visit.
p255_339|today we begin to answer that question.
p255_340|look at the witnesses.
p255_341|nobody else was with me.
p255_342|a change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p255_343|that is the very reason why it was so vital.
p255_344|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p255_345|this is a friendly match?
p255_346|i was pleased to be back on the podium in brazil.
p255_347|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p255_348|on the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p255_349|that is a break with tradition.
p255_350|i kept going for her.
p255_351|the scottish parliament should set an example for westminster to follow.
p255_352|he's very explosive.
p255_353|i was in the train station overnight.
p255_354|it benefits the whole family.
p255_355|it was one in the afternoon.
p255_356|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p255_357|we will be homeless.
p255_358|it was fit for royalty.
p255_359|we are looking for perfection.
p255_360|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p255_361|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p255_362|i have got a wife to feed.
p255_363|i wanted to help the poor people in edinburgh.
p255_364|not so it seems.
p255_365|tell it like it was?
p255_366|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p255_367|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p255_368|he put some colour into scottish history.
p255_369|i decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p255_370|they received a reply from their own managers.
p255_371|by that time however it was already too late.
p255_372|yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p255_373|it's a long process.
p255_374|not because they want to sing about something.
p255_375|he could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p255_376|colour was at the core of his life.
p255_377|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p255_378|it was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p255_379|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p255_380|the casualties were not named.
p255_381|i looked again at its vision for a scottish parliament.
p256_001|please call stella.
p256_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p256_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p256_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p256_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p256_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p256_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p256_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p256_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p256_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p256_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p256_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p256_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p256_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p256_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p256_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p256_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p256_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p256_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p256_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p256_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p256_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p256_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p256_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p256_025|it's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p256_026|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p256_027|i have a theory.
p256_028|suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p256_029|there's a story too.
p256_030|i was an athlete.
p256_031|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p256_032|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p256_033|then suddenly they weren't.
p256_034|a web site is planned for november.
p256_035|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p256_036|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p256_037|at this stage we think the air campaign is enough.
p256_038|they're just different.
p256_039|it's a real threat.
p256_040|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p256_041|it had been played at festivals.
p256_042|indeed he does.
p256_043|she is believed to be in south africa.
p256_044|this film will be totally awesome.
p256_045|no meaningful response was issued.
p256_046|that period was a struggle.
p256_047|a neighbour said.
p256_048|it's a crucial award.
p256_049|it is difficult for ali.
p256_050|it's a blessing.
p256_051|is a drug dealer?
p256_052|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p256_053|i would love to have him home.
p256_054|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p256_055|he had no enemies.
p256_056|sadly it can't.
p256_057|there would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p256_058|it is unique.
p256_059|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p256_060|that's the truth.
p256_061|that is very hard alone.
p256_062|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p256_063|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p256_064|and a film maker was born.
p256_065|it's a matter of balance.
p256_066|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p256_067|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p256_068|they may yet have the last laugh.
p256_069|there was a battle there.
p256_070|they are real.
p256_071|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p256_072|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p256_073|it should be devolved.
p256_074|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p256_075|i was as strong as a horse.
p256_076|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p256_077|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p256_078|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p256_079|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p256_080|it is a terrible place.
p256_081|i've got the shirt.
p256_082|this is the way things should be handled.
p256_083|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p256_084|it is a matter of the utmost concern to the allies.
p256_085|it may well have been.
p256_086|i first met him last summer.
p256_087|last week he was taken into hospital.
p256_088|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p256_089|it's never too late.
p256_090|it was nice.
p256_091|we do not get that impression now.
p256_092|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p256_093|that will come after the game on saturday.
p256_094|a council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p256_095|we must look forward.
p256_096|i decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p256_097|they've got to account for it.
p256_098|she told the herald.
p256_099|it was clear.
p256_100|there was no rescue.
p256_101|we could not get any possession.
p256_102|they are now divorced.
p256_103|the court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p256_104|journalists should make him.
p256_105|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p256_106|get to know him.
p256_107|but it was a pleasure.
p256_108|we have every respect for michelle.
p256_109|but they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p256_110|i didn't play well last year.
p256_111|before the game we went for a pint.
p256_112|they will want to perform well.
p256_113|it's not perfect.
p256_114|it was the eighties.
p256_115|they were behind the wheel.
p256_116|this is a step backwards.
p256_117|it was ugly.
p256_118|it would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p256_119|i joined a group.
p256_120|it is rubbish.
p256_121|who would be a referee?
p256_122|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p256_123|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p256_124|the whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p256_125|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p256_126|there were no grounds for his action.
p256_127|wednesday night was a difficult time for britton.
p256_128|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p256_129|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p256_130|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p256_131|our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p256_132|well you can have a tree.
p256_133|who will attend?
p256_134|her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p256_135|the trial is funded solely by edinburgh city council.
p256_136|our intentions are real.
p256_137|it is also well received.
p256_138|we never said that we would walk through the third division.
p256_139|police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p256_140|it was very frightened and dirty.
p256_141|we want to keep the pound.
p256_142|and the farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p256_143|the way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p256_144|it changed my life.
p256_145|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p256_146|it is not just about pay.
p256_147|the home side didn't stand a chance.
p256_148|i was so nervous.
p256_149|crucially though united were still alive.
p256_150|they have not been named.
p256_151|there's a sense of excess in the novel.
p256_152|we should be clear about the role of government.
p256_153|it was by the numbers.
p256_154|she also defended the lord chancellor's existing powers.
p256_155|we will turn the corner.
p256_156|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p256_157|he can do no wrong.
p256_158|alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p256_159|these days are long gone.
p256_160|i will tell you.
p256_161|a labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p256_162|it has to be now.
p256_163|we have to move forward.
p256_164|they are not advertised.
p256_165|we knew we had the goal we wanted.
p256_166|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p256_167|by then however both men were already in the us.
p256_168|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p256_169|the post will be unpaid.
p256_170|does that put pressure on us?
p256_171|waiting times for these services are too long.
p256_172|it is too much for me.
p256_173|we've made a couple of albums.
p256_174|it is not either national standards or local control.
p256_175|if that's the case he will struggle.
p256_176|the hotel was now for sale.
p256_177|the conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p256_178|they took a risk.
p256_179|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p256_180|there is no point in looking any further.
p256_181|nothing is safe.
p256_182|they will run a mile.
p256_183|four policemen were wounded.
p256_184|they receive a high profile in the media.
p256_185|we did everything by the book.
p256_186|they need to look after themselves.
p256_187|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p256_188|my main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p256_189|it is a terrible loss.
p256_190|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p256_191|if the director is with you.
p256_192|i am totally surprised.
p256_193|i grew up listening to these people.
p256_194|the spokeswoman said the flat in london was very small.
p256_195|mr kennedy is not a candidate for the scottish parliament.
p256_196|it is a case of taking a risk.
p256_197|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p256_198|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p256_199|people acted too quickly.
p256_200|i have a cold.
p256_201|the plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p256_202|tommy is not a problem.
p256_203|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p256_204|they've got three quarters of the way.
p256_205|but she might be.
p256_206|it was worth a photograph.
p256_207|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p256_208|it's like a garage.
p256_209|but i am a worried man.
p256_210|harry potter has lost his magic.
p256_211|she should not be blamed.
p256_212|it had all been arranged.
p256_213|the second is the reaction of the hibs fans.
p256_214|the fbi could become involved.
p256_215|a final decision will be taken by first minister donald dewar.
p256_216|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p256_217|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p256_218|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p256_219|we've got the bronze.
p256_220|it's so special.
p256_221|we will be victorious.
p256_222|he seemed to lose his focus.
p256_223|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p256_224|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p256_225|i am immensely sad.
p256_226|it is a gamble.
p256_227|my neighbours are horrified.
p256_228|the track is currently covered in snow.
p256_229|i am very sorry that alastair campbell has taken this decision.
p256_230|they are the innocent victims.
p256_231|my wife and family are the support system.
p256_232|the body follows the mind.
p256_233|it is set in paris.
p256_234|it's quite nice.
p256_235|it's a lovely lovely film.
p256_236|a succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p256_237|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p256_238|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p256_239|he was good but not that good.
p256_240|he claimed the government had lost the plot.
p256_241|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p256_242|it would appear that it has not been a problem.
p256_243|it is hard won.
p256_244|he says that he is no different from any other man.
p256_245|the scene is about this?
p256_246|some families have even requested to leave the city.
p256_247|we will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p256_248|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p256_249|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p256_250|it was a hit.
p256_251|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p256_252|her presence was almost everywhere.
p256_253|i was never going to play against scotland.
p256_254|at the end of the day one has to be careful.
p256_255|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p256_256|the bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p256_257|chelsea was a great club.
p256_258|that's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p256_259|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p256_260|it is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p256_261|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p256_262|i am very angry.
p256_263|the pensioners did not want to know.
p256_264|i have never been a close friend of jim mclean.
p256_265|he raised the profile of the european tour to the sky.
p256_266|their findings are published in the journal injury prevention.
p256_267|that's the only thing i will say.
p256_268|it looks as though he will be right.
p256_269|of course that is not the whole story.
p256_270|he has not created a festival resource.
p256_271|frankly we should all have such problems.
p256_272|it was an easy decision to come here.
p256_273|and michael was just great.
p256_274|she has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p256_275|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p256_276|i am an estate agent.
p256_277|they were on holiday in egypt.
p256_278|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p256_279|it happens from time to time.
p256_280|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p256_281|but i've won both ways.
p256_282|i saw it at a ruck.
p256_283|the attacker died in the crash.
p256_284|the government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p256_285|it's like a high school play.
p256_286|scotland were beaten again.
p256_287|it's very safe.
p256_288|he was obviously very genuine.
p256_289|she said she could not believe that they had run away.
p256_290|it shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p256_291|he wrote the letter two days before he died.
p256_292|the results are sometimes contentious.
p256_293|the songs are just so good.
p256_294|who can predict?
p256_295|they are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
p256_296|it became a book by itself.
p256_297|the home was now under new management.
p256_298|i thought it was my only chance.
p256_300|one was a lawyer.
p256_301|our task is to complete the picture.
p256_302|the party lasted all night.
p256_303|it's so awful.
p256_304|it's just not funny
p256_305|it is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p256_306|funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p256_307|it is no surprise.
p256_308|let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p256_309|o neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p256_310|we have waited a long time for this.
p256_311|this is the culture change in medicine.
p256_312|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p256_313|this wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p256_314|it is all credit to them today.
p256_315|they were fantastic.
p256_316|there is no other solution to congestion in edinburgh.
p256_317|she is very distinctive.
p256_318|it's not even finished.
p256_319|henman has been warned.
p256_320|it should be equal.
p257_001|please call stella.
p257_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p257_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p257_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p257_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p257_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p257_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p257_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p257_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p257_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p257_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p257_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p257_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p257_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p257_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p257_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p257_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p257_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p257_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p257_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p257_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p257_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p257_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p257_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p257_025|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p257_026|is this accurate?
p257_027|they should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p257_028|because we do not need it.
p257_029|life was like a timetable.
p257_030|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p257_031|it was clear.
p257_032|clark was desperate to return to the house of commons.
p257_033|i came to complete.
p257_034|president bush is at war.
p257_035|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p257_036|i was scared.
p257_037|it was ugly.
p257_038|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p257_039|it's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p257_040|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p257_041|a neighbour said.
p257_042|we need to chat.
p257_043|the boy is no longer with us.
p257_044|i hate the word.
p257_045|that should do it.
p257_046|it's a blessing.
p257_047|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p257_048|as she explains.
p257_049|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p257_050|he had no enemies.
p257_051|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p257_052|but the law is very clear on this.
p257_053|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p257_054|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p257_055|next league matches celtic.
p257_056|it's very odd.
p257_057|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p257_058|it is not great art.
p257_059|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p257_060|there was a battle there.
p257_061|scotland had great assets.
p257_062|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p257_063|have a look at our accounts.
p257_064|sounds like the sixth sense?
p257_065|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p257_066|i was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p257_067|it's all i can do.
p257_068|there could be a way back.
p257_069|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p257_070|the price cuts are really exciting.
p257_071|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p257_072|i had my suspicions.
p257_073|she died in hospital two hours later.
p257_074|it was chaotic.
p257_075|is there a new way forward?
p257_076|i've not thought about it.
p257_077|people must remain vigilant.
p257_078|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p257_079|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p257_080|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p257_081|it may well have been.
p257_082|he liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p257_083|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p257_084|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p257_085|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p257_086|it's never too late.
p257_087|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p257_088|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p257_089|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p257_090|today i couldn't run on it.
p257_091|we must look forward.
p257_092|it is an old family habit.
p257_093|he was possessed
p257_094|she told the herald.
p257_095|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p257_096|the peace process will be buried
p257_097|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p257_098|they are now divorced.
p257_099|they were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p257_100|it was mayhem.
p257_101|however the intensive care unit at the southern general hospital was full.
p257_102|tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on europe.
p257_103|we have every respect for michelle.
p257_104|that time is not now however.
p257_105|i didn't play well last year.
p257_106|for these people the ruling is very welcome.
p257_107|they will want to perform well.
p257_108|they had to be cut from the wreckage.
p257_109|i did not think about the ryder cup.
p257_110|it is normal.
p257_111|i was fighting for my life i thought.
p257_112|i don't have many friends.
p257_113|it's a shame.
p257_114|it was the eighties.
p257_115|we do not expect any surplus.
p257_116|naturally it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p257_117|it's not a new concept in jazz.
p257_118|we are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p257_119|i'm delighted about that.
p257_120|does this mean.
p257_121|this is the first big idea of the scottish parliament election.
p257_122|he did his job.
p257_123|you can spend money on housing.
p257_124|that's all right then.
p257_125|i was furious.
p257_126|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p257_127|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p257_128|it's terrible that he has died the same way.
p257_129|so the european elections are extremely important.
p257_130|buckingham palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p257_131|who will attend?
p257_132|the trial is funded solely by edinburgh city council.
p257_133|the whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p257_134|i am now unemployed.
p257_135|customers for the panels include the national trust for scotland.
p257_136|they made such decisions in london.
p257_137|our intentions are real.
p257_138|it is also well received.
p257_139|what will happen then?
p257_140|it's not true.
p257_141|i feel very grateful with everything.
p257_142|we are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p257_143|nobody in the world can get away from him.
p257_144|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p257_145|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p257_146|there is a lack of chemistry.
p257_147|that could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p257_148|it is like a football team.
p257_149|that group reported just before christmas.
p257_150|he will emerge as a world leader.
p257_151|it opens the door to the champions league.
p257_152|they did very well.
p257_153|it became a book by itself.
p257_154|but he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p257_155|the weather forecast isn't good.
p257_156|there's a sense of excess in the novel.
p257_157|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p257_158|there's a pause.
p257_159|he can do no wrong.
p257_160|it was so new so exciting.
p257_161|i've learned from my mistakes.
p257_162|a labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p257_163|i've put my own money into this project.
p257_164|however the french government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p257_165|i lost my head.
p257_166|you are not going in blind.
p257_167|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p257_168|as far as we were concerned the deal with kennedy was dead.
p257_169|and i was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p257_170|my life has been destroyed.
p257_171|there was no hint of scandal.
p257_172|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p257_173|i feel like my game has come a long way.
p257_174|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p257_175|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p257_176|it's quite a routine.
p257_177|there is no evidence of a little scotland emerging.

p257_195|ferguson should take note.

p257_197|it's just awful.
p257_198|we see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p257_199|it s all in the hair.
p257_200|we have an election in eight days.
p257_201|but i am a worried man.
p257_202|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p257_203|saddam hussein is a devil.
p257_204|he knows a lot.
p257_205|he is slightly confused.
p257_206|her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p257_207|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p257_208|i am delighted for simon.
p257_209|it had all been arranged.
p257_210|a grampian police spokesman said.
p257_211|we have got to get it right.
p257_212|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p257_213|i might come back.
p257_214|his death was a tragic accident.
p257_215|it's just a place to open it.
p257_216|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p257_217|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p257_218|william hague delighted his party.

p257_231|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p257_232|john prescott the deputy prime minister will fly to the summit tomorrow.
p257_233|but it's a subtle process.
p257_234|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p257_235|my future is in the marathon.
p257_236|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p257_237|a change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p257_238|they may yet have the last laugh.
p257_239|you can feel at home in china.
p257_240|it is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p257_241|i should think so too.
p257_242|we decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p257_243|i didn't need to watch it on the video.
p257_244|he said he was impressed by the set up at celtic.
p257_245|i will not allow the destruction of the scottish fishing industry.
p257_246|we need to move away from the culture of long hours.

p257_250|they are interior designers and architects.
p257_251|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.

p257_253|it is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p257_254|i would have the hammer in the crowd.
p257_255|he thought he had a month to cross the street.
p257_256|he raised the profile of the european tour to the sky.
p257_257|blood samples were taken.
p257_258|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p257_259|it's very nice.
p257_260|frankly we should all have such problems.
p257_261|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p257_262|we do not want any terrorist attacks on any israeli civilians.
p257_263|and michael was just great.
p257_264|we're in shock.
p257_265|everything will fall into place it should be fine.
p257_266|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p257_267|one knows the feeling.
p257_268|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p257_269|she looked so young.
p257_270|it was a privilege to work for him.
p257_271|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p257_272|he looked very sharp.
p257_273|you've got to have both sides.
p257_274|who did the recruiting?
p257_275|police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p257_276|well he can do it.
p257_277|it shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p257_278|it is a vote of confidence in the skills in scotland.
p257_279|he added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p257_280|the results are sometimes contentious.
p257_281|he should have won.
p257_282|a new school will be built.
p257_283|right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p257_284|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p257_285|what has altered?
p257_286|the home was now under new management.
p257_287|graeme was prepared.
p257_288|i thought it was my only chance.
p257_289|however the snow was welcomed by some.
p257_290|it just came into my head that day.
p257_291|they are wrong.
p257_292|details of the new vessel were given in london yesterday.
p257_293|it's just not funny
p257_294|i am very happy to be here.
p257_295|the plot is minimal.
p257_296|it wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p257_297|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p257_298|this is the culture change in medicine.
p257_299|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p257_300|they were fantastic.
p257_301|i never thought it would take this long.
p257_302|in fact they have the opposite effect.
p257_303|they wanted the club to make money.
p257_304|kids are terrible.
p257_305|henman has been warned.
p257_306|it should be equal.
p257_307|ms anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p257_308|the home team had an amazing start.
p257_309|it is out there.
p257_310|they had a confession.
p257_311|davis is very supportive as a director.
p257_312|we are in the end game.
p257_313|i came into this world with nothing.
p257_314|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p257_315|i am so upset.
p257_316|the boat was fantastic.
p257_317|i saw some good things.
p257_318|finally he paid for the movie.
p257_319|you can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p257_320|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p257_321|three years ago he would have been.
p257_322|you feel the pride.
p257_323|it is so unfair.
p257_324|the announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p257_325|indeed it was magical.
p257_326|i've got no secret.
p257_327|look at the witnesses.
p257_328|i'm very lucky.
p257_329|we must do something.
p257_330|he says that he is no different from any other man.
p257_331|alex ferguson is the same.
p257_332|i was pleased to be back on the podium in brazil.
p257_333|like his acting it was an accident.
p257_334|it is not like working for a living.
p257_335|it is long gone.
p257_336|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p257_337|tell us about it.
p257_338|the salary changes are long overdue.
p257_339|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p257_340|it was very formal.
p257_341|the pressure is on celtic in the main.
p257_342|tyson is overwhelmed.
p257_343|we are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p257_344|i wanted to go out on a high.
p257_345|instead he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p257_346|i felt really good until friday.
p257_347|his legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p257_348|he could face a jail sentence.
p257_349|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p257_350|i decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p257_351|i am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p257_352|then followed a bout of flu.
p257_353|there is no signature.
p257_354|it's a long process.
p257_355|it is a large number.
p257_356|he knew his job inside out.
p257_357|i wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p257_358|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p257_359|it does not even have a staff shortage.
p257_360|i haven't had a kick at a celtic player for a while.
p257_361|he has the edge.
p257_362|he denied the charge.
p257_363|there were no casualties.
p257_364|since then he has played no active part in the company.
p257_365|you thought it was a headache.
p257_366|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p257_367|a council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p257_368|they really did a great job.
p257_369|there is a solution she believes.
p257_370|however it's good to turn the page.
p257_371|this year i understood.
p257_372|i'm pleased about one thing.
p257_373|it is unusual.
p257_374|it is also claimed that he was murdered.
p257_375|it is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
p257_376|i can lead by example.
p257_377|well it did last time he was reminded.
p257_378|they are good.
p257_379|he repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p257_380|my husband was born in zimbabwe.
p257_381|so in a sense it was a government subsidy.
p257_382|it was on fire.
p257_383|the orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p257_384|i never won a penny throughout my career.
p257_385|emotions were complex.
p257_386|he's already made history.
p257_387|so i did.
p257_388|you ask the question.
p257_389|whether the high court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p257_390|there was no trouble.
p257_391|this is a huge confidence boost.
p257_392|not because they want to sing about something.
p257_393|it is not a standing army.
p257_394|we haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p257_395|i believe the gap is nearly there.
p257_396|you wanted the evidence.
p257_397|our numbers are small.
p257_398|i was very young.
p257_399|we have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p257_400|i am the son of sam.
p257_401|she is superb.
p257_402|today he is in the same position as four years ago.
p257_403|it doesn't always work that way.
p257_404|it is simple but profound.
p257_405|no preference emerged.
p257_406|but they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p257_407|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p257_408|she has reached the top of her profession.
p257_409|it goes with the job.
p257_410|the edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p257_411|now however it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p257_412|i recommend a tour.
p257_413|we are delighted with this outcome.
p257_414|i have so much respect for him.
p257_415|we shall be victorious.
p257_416|rather than answer she resigned.
p257_417|war is not the action.
p257_418|they said so that i would look good in uniform.
p257_419|it's not about defining styles.
p257_420|one must hope not
p257_421|it is marvellous.
p257_422|but it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p257_423|they should not be blamed for it.
p257_424|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p257_425|it is bizarre.
p257_426|mary archer is almost too clever.
p257_427|i was just overwhelmed.
p257_428|it had been in place since last july.
p257_429|it's a miracle.
p257_430|the first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
p257_431|that was the first time i worked with richard.
p257_432|they will form a tribute.
p257_433|the whole region is in shock.
p257_434|the bill would be massive.
p258_001|please call stella.
p258_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p258_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p258_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p258_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p258_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p258_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p258_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p258_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p258_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p258_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p258_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p258_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p258_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p258_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p258_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p258_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p258_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p258_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p258_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p258_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p258_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p258_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p258_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p258_025|johnson was pretty low.
p258_026|it's nice to hear.
p258_027|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p258_028|they should be so lucky.
p258_029|because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p258_030|however the following year the cancer returned.
p258_031|because we do not need it.
p258_032|he took me on a tour of the wards.
p258_033|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p258_034|i'd like to continue that record.
p258_035|it was clear.
p258_036|it is not for any other purpose.
p258_037|president bush is at war.
p258_038|i was scared.
p258_039|it will come all right.
p258_040|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p258_041|the judge said.
p258_042|we need to chat.
p258_043|it's a blessing.
p258_044|as she explains.
p258_045|she looked so young.
p258_046|he looks like an afghan.
p258_047|it is the whole package.
p258_048|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p258_049|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p258_050|that's the day job.
p258_051|we have not given up hope.
p258_052|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p258_053|that is very hard alone.
p258_054|it's that kind of place.
p258_055|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p258_056|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p258_057|he was popular.
p258_058|it should be devolved.
p258_059|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p258_060|try to save us.
p258_061|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p258_062|sounds like the sixth sense?
p258_063|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p258_064|that was the easy election.
p258_065|it's all i can do.
p258_066|the price cuts are really exciting.
p258_067|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p258_068|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p258_069|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p258_070|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p258_071|he got the same story.
p258_072|this is the way things should be handled.
p258_073|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p258_074|it is a matter of the utmost concern to the allies.
p258_075|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p258_076|i first met him last summer.
p258_077|last week he was taken into hospital.
p258_078|nothing is yet confirmed.
p258_079|new zealand rugby is totally different.
p258_080|we have other options.
p258_081|every time i play i do not understand their reaction.
p258_082|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p258_083|today i couldn't run on it.
p258_084|they are different types.
p258_085|it is a simple equation.
p258_086|until you hit the big games.
p258_087|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p258_088|there was no rescue.
p258_089|she's got to say something.
p258_090|the selection process is still at a very early stage.
p258_091|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p258_092|clark was desperate to return to the house of commons.
p258_093|journalists should make him.
p258_094|but it was a pleasure.
p258_095|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p258_096|oil embargo endorsed.
p258_097|it is a good lifestyle.
p258_098|before the game we went for a pint.
p258_099|now though he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p258_100|it's not perfect.
p258_101|they had to be cut from the wreckage.
p258_102|she has been shot.
p258_103|he plans to call for an aid package from mr macdonald.
p258_104|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p258_105|we do not expect any surplus.
p258_106|he said he was impressed by the set up at celtic.
p258_107|it is so sad.
p258_108|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p258_109|we are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p258_110|this film will be totally awesome.
p258_111|maybe this battle has been.
p258_112|until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p258_113|i joined a group.
p258_114|this is the end of a chapter and it is very sad.
p258_115|who would have?
p258_116|it is a delight on every level.
p258_117|you can spend money on housing.
p258_118|here again they were denied a voice.
p258_119|overall it was a promising day for the scots.
p258_120|there will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p258_121|i could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p258_122|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p258_123|she does not want to speak.
p258_124|it's terrible that he has died the same way.
p258_125|so the european elections are extremely important.
p258_126|our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p258_127|buckingham palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p258_128|wish i could be there on sunday in person but i can't.
p258_129|the move has provoked a mixed response.
p258_130|the role was perfect for russell.
p258_131|it plans to return to this field.
p258_132|they made such decisions in london.
p258_133|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p258_134|my conscience is not clear.
p258_135|i am totally devoted to this job.
p258_136|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p258_137|if people are genuine then the problem is not osama bin laden.
p258_138|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p258_139|is that titanic?
p258_140|he sets the nature of his parliament in a simple realistic context.
p258_141|labour's scottish general secretary alex rowley was delighted yesterday.
p258_142|it opens the door to the champions league.
p258_143|you know the type.
p258_144|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p258_145|the fbi could become involved.
p258_146|the weather forecast isn't good.
p258_147|she had gone to the catholic school.
p258_148|my dad is a hero.
p258_149|the weather affected the other two games in fife.
p258_150|neither side can win this war.
p258_151|was this element always there?
p258_152|these days are long gone.

p258_380|colour was at the core of his life.
p258_381|ms mcneill was killed on impact.

p258_384|it is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p258_385|it is a temptation which should be resisted.
p258_386|that team is due to be announced this morning.
p258_387|that's the name of the game though.
p258_388|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p258_389|i was so nervous.
p258_390|you thought it was a headache.
p258_391|there is a solution she believes.
p258_392|however it's good to turn the page.
p258_393|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p258_394|this year i understood.
p258_395|public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p258_396|i suspect the latter.
p258_397|these guys are looking for business.
p258_398|he is on the wrong side.
p258_399|it was a breathtaking moment.
p258_400|the car was just there.
p258_401|but in fact the reverse is true.
p258_402|it is full scale.
p258_403|my house was shaking at the time.
p258_404|then he laughs.
p258_405|they are not left wing.
p258_406|a new leader is unlikely to be chosen before september.
p258_407|we have not yet received a letter from the irish.
p258_408|he scored a touchdown.
p258_409|the visual arts committee took this decision in december.

p258_413|domestic disturbance is currently on general release.
p258_414|also it is the season of goodwill.

p259_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p259_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p259_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p259_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p259_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p259_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p259_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p259_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p259_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p259_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p259_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p259_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p259_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p259_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p259_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p259_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p259_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p259_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p259_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p259_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p259_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p259_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p259_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p259_025|but it could prove disastrous.
p259_026|smoking is also very important.
p259_027|suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p259_028|i am pretty careful with money.
p259_029|he has the courage of the unaware.
p259_030|i could not do it.

p259_038|it all started with a visiting rugby club.
p259_039|i feel so desperately sorry for gordon and sarah.
p259_040|clark was desperate to return to the house of commons.
p259_041|it carried a double message.
p259_042|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p259_043|several investments have already been made.
p259_044|the boy is no longer with us.
p259_045|among them are many criminals.

p259_048|they had to explain it.
p259_049|i had come back from london.
p259_050|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p259_051|i had trouble with the producers.
p259_052|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p259_053|we have not given up hope.
p259_054|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p259_055|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p259_056|they had been in scotland on exercise.

p259_067|she died in hospital two hours later.
p259_068|it is a job creation scheme.
p259_069|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p259_070|even the one she loved.
p259_071|today it was really enjoyable.
p259_072|just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p259_073|it was a unanimous decision.
p259_074|it makes for an interesting conference.

p259_119|we have the mental strength.

p259_125|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.

p259_296|these figures are truly terrible.
p259_297|i felt about this big.
p259_298|it is also very valuable.

p259_313|we have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p259_314|it was at the royal concert hall in glasgow.

p259_330|no briton has ever won.
p259_331|are they free ?
p259_332|what are they for ?
p259_333|is there a waiting list ?
p259_334|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p259_335|so what happens next ?
p259_336|had this been common practice ?
p259_337|what do they want us to do ?
p259_338|is it worth it ?
p259_339|his appeal is instantly understood.
p259_340|the results are sometimes contentious.

p259_353|we think the timing is good.
p259_354|he will go a long way.
p259_355|we want to play at the worlds.
p259_356|other people had looked at it.
p259_357|the advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p259_358|i didn't have the reply.
p259_359|the output price index in december was unchanged on november.
p259_360|you may have a short memory.
p259_361|ms anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p259_362|a home office spokesman said.
p259_363|urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p259_364|it's too horrible to think.
p259_365|hopefully he will get a lucky break.
p259_366|industrial action has to hurt.
p259_367|nobody said it was required.
p259_368|it was tough to contain the excitement.
p259_369|they promised to fight the plans.
p259_370|shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p259_371|he was unable to come.
p259_372|he was at school in devon.
p259_373|many of these properties are located in the south of england.
p259_374|finally came the moment of truth.
p259_375|whether this return was too soon.
p259_376|neither man has been charged.
p259_377|an alternative must be offered.
p259_378|it is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p259_379|it has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p259_380|he can handle it without any problem.

p259_382|he is an excellent manager.
p259_383|i think we'll just keep it.
p259_384|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p259_385|i've always been a sensitive.
p259_386|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p259_387|he had no previous convictions.
p259_388|it was a massive error of judgment.
p259_389|they should take their mobile phones.
p259_390|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p259_391|they have broken that promise.
p259_392|does it matter ?
p259_393|how do you take them away ?
p259_394|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p259_395|after the match do you ?
p259_396|that is a crazy situation.
p259_397|we are really good friends.
p259_398|the principle is quite clear.
p259_399|the salary changes are long overdue.
p259_400|the policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
p259_401|she said they would appeal.
p259_402|they were to blame for the first two goals.
p259_403|it would be quite nice.
p259_404|this remains the party's policy.
p259_405|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p259_406|the parties include the scottish executive.
p259_407|we will win the argument.
p259_408|everything is now in place for manchester.
p259_409|tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p259_410|the team hadn't been picked.
p259_411|the prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
p259_412|it sounds like a wish list.
p259_413|the director will be present.
p259_414|it is the nature of his party.
p259_415|theatre is not a museum.
p259_416|we have very limited capacity.
p259_417|it is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p259_418|my view has now completely changed.
p259_419|i had a fortunate war.
p259_420|it's too close to call.
p259_421|i was happy to be recognised by mike tyson.
p259_422|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p259_423|i've had a wonderful career.
p259_424|the bbc was a disgrace.
p259_425|it is hard to understand.
p259_426|but the foundations have been laid.
p259_427|there was an element of frustration.
p259_428|in general terms the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p259_429|the casualties were not named.
p259_430|the next few months will tell.
p259_431|it is not over by any means.
p259_432|a ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p259_433|three years ago he would have been.
p259_434|they've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p259_435|i watch the other visitors.
p259_436|george is on a two day visit to scotland.
p259_437|even if they come out playing a physical game we can cope.
p259_438|this market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p259_439|there is a solution she believes.
p259_440|his ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p259_441|it was submitted without their knowledge.
p259_442|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p259_443|my aim is a top six finish.
p259_444|it means an enormous amount.
p259_445|such an attack is bizarre.
p259_446|if he saw somebody in trouble he would try to help.
p259_447|i never had a childhood.
p259_448|no one wanted to run it tonight.
p259_449|none of the pieces was commissioned.
p259_450|there is another important factor.
p259_451|i never found my rhythm.
p259_452|in fact the reasons are simple.
p259_453|strangely enough i felt very sharp.
p259_454|it is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p259_455|nobody has told the story.
p259_456|last week against nelson we allowed them several opportunities.
p259_457|he confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
p259_458|senior management in scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p259_459|the project is entitled the composer in scotland.
p259_460|it is pretty bad news.
p259_461|it certainly appeared that way.
p259_462|we put our bid in last night.
p259_463|quality was high in all sections.
p259_464|it could cause a little bit of disruption.
p259_465|but we have built a platform for next season.
p259_466|i think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p259_467|they offer a kind of narrative.
p259_468|she came to the highland show.
p259_469|it was like someone had died.
p259_470|they were good years for him.
p259_471|let that be their memorial.
p259_472|then came the farewell to europe.
p259_473|i'm very passionate about my country.
p259_474|phil mickelson did that last year.
p259_475|there was no trouble at all.
p259_476|he deserved a red card.
p259_477|the price paid for it was not disclosed.
p259_478|you have to have a proven track record to get them.
p259_479|some problems were too complex.
p259_480|their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p259_481|the chief constable has retired.
p260_001|please call stella.
p260_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p260_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p260_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p260_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p260_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p260_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p260_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p260_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p260_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p260_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p260_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p260_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p260_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p260_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p260_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p260_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p260_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p260_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p260_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p260_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p260_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p260_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p260_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p260_025|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p260_026|we will be homeless.
p260_027|is this accurate?
p260_028|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p260_029|they have no history.
p260_030|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p260_031|i'd just like to play.
p260_032|there's a story too.
p260_033|this is the window.
p260_034|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p260_035|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p260_036|then suddenly they weren't.
p260_037|it's a fact.
p260_038|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p260_039|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p260_040|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p260_041|dancing was her life.
p260_042|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p260_043|we will push.
p260_044|the shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p260_045|among them are many criminals.
p260_046|it is marvellous.
p260_047|every aspect of our play was first class.
p260_048|our people are ready.
p260_049|here's a clue.
p260_050|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p260_051|i was inspired by two things.
p260_052|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p260_053|my fitness was very poor.
p260_054|sadly it can't.
p260_055|he has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p260_056|i expect a rapid response.
p260_057|what was the main difference?
p260_058|there's a danger.
p260_059|we need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p260_060|lancashire police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p260_061|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p260_062|it's that kind of place.
p260_063|they are real.
p260_064|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p260_065|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p260_066|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p260_067|that was a gold medal for certain.
p260_068|we should have known.
p260_069|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p260_070|robin williams is very subdued.
p260_071|he was at home with his pals.
p260_072|it was magic.
p260_073|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p260_074|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p260_075|is there a new way forward?
p260_076|the party is up for it.
p260_077|even the one she loved.
p260_078|people must remain vigilant.
p260_079|today she has been released.
p260_080|who will pay for this?
p260_081|he had taken everything from me.
p260_082|he seems to be pleased with the picture.

p260_229|there is no excuse.
p260_230|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p260_231|but it's a subtle process.
p260_232|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p260_233|the car was just there.

p260_323|henman has been warned.
p260_324|i would love it.

p260_329|we are in the end game.

p260_348|a great deal has been achieved.
p260_349|yet for my money he was not the man of the match.
p260_350|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p260_351|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p260_352|they should take their mobile phones.

p260_355|we have big ideas.
p260_356|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p260_357|i first met him last summer.
p261_001|please call stella.
p261_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p261_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.

p261_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p261_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p261_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p261_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p261_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p261_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p261_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p261_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p261_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p261_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p261_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p261_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p261_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p261_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p261_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p261_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p261_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p261_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p261_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p261_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p261_025|they are very clever in their use of words.
p261_026|meetings will also remain private.
p261_027|because we do not need it.
p261_028|life was like a timetable.
p261_029|last night mr robertson said he was delighted.
p261_030|we will look into it.
p261_031|i have never been a member of the council.
p261_032|it was a close call.
p261_033|that means an extra two years.

p261_051|i must take a seat.

p261_066|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p261_067|that's not the intention at all.
p261_068|it starts with the script.
p261_069|there could be a way back.
p261_070|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p261_071|then followed a bout of flu.

p261_115|it isn't a happy memory.
p261_116|actors like to be in the centre.
p261_117|it's not a quick fix.
p261_118|but it took a lot of bottle.
p261_119|structural changes were also required.
p261_120|i was deeply saddened by the death of donald dewar.
p261_121|it is too pretty it is too small.
p261_122|i was on a roll.
p261_123|the deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p261_124|my life has changed a lot.
p261_125|if not a deal could take many months.

p261_142|drugs are used a lot at the fishing not just cannabis.
p261_143|the balance isn't there at emi.

p261_146|like the others he was arrested.
p261_147|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p261_148|crucially though united were still alive.
p261_149|the point is raised again that evening at the assembly rooms.
p261_150|it was by the numbers.
p261_151|but i am still awaiting an answer.
p261_152|we will turn the corner.
p261_153|he was asked to quit.
p261_154|this might seem like an outrageous assertion.

p261_165|next year it plans to open an office in tokyo.
p261_166|the region is open for business.
p261_167|they could not match it.
p261_168|what happened in that game ?
p261_169|are you going to win ?
p261_170|was it the wife ?
p261_171|why change it ?
p261_172|what do we want to do that for ?
p261_173|this is no reflection on rangers.
p261_174|i always felt they played for me.
p261_175|you have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p261_176|it is a body blow.
p261_177|the jury is still out.
p261_178|it is not either national standards or local control.
p261_179|city sentiment is in his favour.
p261_180|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p261_181|these men could be anywhere in the world.

p261_183|says the duke of york.
p261_184|equally he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p261_185|i had too much to drink.
p261_186|they need to look after themselves.
p261_187|he prefers to play for them.
p261_188|that is a waste of energy.
p261_189|it could be done by experts and lawyers.
p261_190|david sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p261_191|that was the theory anyway.
p261_192|it was a pre emptive strike.
p261_193|it had been in place since last july.
p261_194|both banks are heavily involved in the scottish market.
p261_195|this year it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p261_196|it's very difficult to find a buyer.
p261_197|we have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p261_198|he should emerge as the winner.
p261_199|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p261_200|i made a terrible start.
p261_201|it was a moment of madness.
p261_202|we believe a third party was involved.
p261_203|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p261_204|it was his own decision.
p261_205|does the name matter ?
p261_206|how do you get it back ?
p261_207|what are you not good at ?
p261_208|i think therefore i am ?
p261_209|who was she ?
p261_210|a deadline is still essential.
p261_211|i chose to go by the rules.
p261_212|i won't make an official complaint.
p261_213|it seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p261_214|they are looking at a flotation.
p261_215|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p261_216|we have an election in eight days.
p261_217|it was far from business as usual.
p261_218|all will be revealed in due course.
p261_219|they have known the hard times.
p261_220|it has been like that all year for me.

p261_227|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p261_228|and the world cup has not even begun.
p261_229|life is too short to be bitter.
p261_230|a terrorist is a terrorist.
p261_231|it could be to do with the location.
p261_232|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p261_233|the statement contained no surprises.
p261_234|a small number of new jobs will also be created.
p261_235|corporate banking would be based in edinburgh.
p261_236|they have not been in touch with the club.
p261_237|i need a publishing deal
p261_238|they tried to give her advice.
p261_239|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p261_240|of course that is not the whole story.
p261_241|no evidence that it was osama bin laden.
p261_242|this is a family club.
p261_243|it is the loss of my name.
p261_244|i haven't made the donation yet.
p261_245|well they were the unlucky ones.
p261_246|the irony was not lost.
p261_247|we have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p261_248|it is not an option but a policy requirement.
p261_249|i was just a kid.
p261_250|it is now the big brother.
p261_251|they showed a lot of heart.
p261_252|nato was not a love affair.
p261_253|he is due in israel tomorrow.
p261_254|it was a poor performance.
p261_255|that is the consistent approach of the government.
p261_256|we want to play at the worlds.
p261_257|our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p261_258|we will listen to any suggestion.
p261_259|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p261_260|i should think so too.
p261_261|no production contract is yet in sight.
p261_262|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p261_263|it seems a shame to leave it.
p261_264|my husband was born in zimbabwe.
p261_265|this idea has been around for four years.
p261_266|the concerns are the same.
p261_267|i can't get a job.
p261_268|and they were being paid ?
p261_269|was everything done to save people ?
p261_270|what was the matter for concern ?
p261_271|do i think about them often ?
p261_272|is it in the right place ?
p261_273|did he trip ?
p261_274|he said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p261_275|i was ready for this.
p261_276|they must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p261_277|blair is very positive at european councils.
p261_278|they are interior designers and architects.
p261_279|that should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p261_280|the scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
p261_281|the offer will run for the next three weekends.
p261_282|at first i thought i was gone.
p261_283|i am just trying to do my job.
p261_284|the morale of the yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p261_285|we're trying to get rounded performers.
p261_286|they can leave at any time.
p261_287|it has the potential to be another north sea.
p261_288|it would be a tragedy if it had to close.
p261_289|he has not created a festival resource.
p261_290|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p261_291|he has run a hell of a race.
p261_292|it would create a scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p261_293|he was also married with two children.
p261_294|it was an easy decision to come here.
p261_295|on wednesday it is the turn of cable wireless.
p261_296|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p261_297|he ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p261_298|a senior party insider said.
p261_299|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p261_300|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p261_301|this will help our confidence.
p261_302|the two companies were not for sale.
p261_303|her appeal is to be heard this week.
p261_304|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p261_305|the cause of the accident remained unclear.
p261_306|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p261_307|it was not hard to feel some sympathy for baxter yesterday.
p261_308|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p261_309|we will deliver at director level.
p261_310|size is not the issue.
p261_311|he will address the nation this evening.
p261_312|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p261_313|tony blair said as little.
p261_314|his was a huge success story.
p261_315|we would hope to make progress on that next year.
p261_316|that is the general feeling.
p261_317|holland won by five wickets.
p261_318|he was obviously very genuine.
p261_319|the casting is as perfect.
p261_320|it was a budget for jobs for scotland.
p261_321|a home office spokesman said.
p261_322|our message to the monetary policy committee is clear.
p261_323|if you can run a computer you can talk to the world.
p261_324|this isn't a betrayal of public services it's their renewal.
p261_325|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p261_326|it is a potential danger.
p261_327|cast away now on general release.
p261_328|that could bring the peace process to a standstill.
p261_329|the city welcomed the numbers.
p261_330|you will never get a conviction.
p261_331|the whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p261_332|that meant the search was unlawful.
p261_333|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p261_334|there will be good prospects ahead.
p261_335|i would do away with the dress code.
p261_336|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p261_337|there is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p261_338|both sides have been hit by injury.
p261_339|what form did that take ?
p261_340|are they free ?
p261_341|what are they for ?
p261_342|is there a waiting list ?
p261_343|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p261_344|so what happens next ?
p261_345|this ruling is a farce.
p261_346|both men were on one year contracts.
p261_347|however walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p261_348|the result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p261_349|the premier league has been a huge success.
p261_350|thousands of british tourists were trapped in their hotels.
p261_351|the whole family was in shock.
p261_352|public opinion was split on the proposal.
p261_353|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p261_354|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p261_355|to beat the european champion is quite nice.
p261_356|i've got a sense of humour too.
p261_357|her life is now back on track.
p261_358|there was some merit in that.
p261_359|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p261_360|it's too horrible to think.
p261_361|they are now out in the cold.
p261_362|at first the youngster was not keen.
p261_363|my view has now completely changed.
p261_364|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p261_365|he was then replaced by ross.
p261_366|he is not very big either.
p261_367|finally came the moment of truth.
p261_368|neither man has been charged.
p261_369|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p261_370|the idea was first mooted a year ago.
p261_371|he did a good job.
p261_372|had this been common practice ?
p261_373|what do they want us to do ?
p261_374|is it worth it ?
p261_375|does it matter ?
p261_376|he took a draw on his cigarette.
p261_377|i am a lucky man.
p261_378|but they have taken the lesson to heart.
p261_379|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p261_380|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p261_381|you did not see it.
p261_382|alex ferguson is the same.
p261_383|they should take their mobile phones.
p261_384|we regret that they were brought in the first place.
p261_385|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p261_386|on the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p261_387|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p261_388|he must have seen the movie.
p261_389|we must put a marker down.
p261_390|the result is called a patent.
p261_391|it's as wide as a church in here.
p261_392|this remains the party's policy.
p261_393|the pair are very much in love.
p261_394|i am a good player.
p261_395|you have to rely on each other.
p261_396|however it was well worth the wait.
p261_397|no other job in world football can compare to this one.
p261_398|i wanted to go out on a high.
p261_399|i felt the head was very like me.
p261_400|it was fit for royalty.
p261_401|the government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p261_402|we operate as a scottish company.
p261_403|how do you take them away ?
p261_404|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p261_405|after the match do you ?
p261_406|he has been in a nursing home for two years.
p261_407|he put some colour into scottish history.
p261_408|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p261_409|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p261_410|motion described it as a unique event.
p261_411|i had a fortunate war.
p261_412|the breakdown was much later in her life.
p261_413|i tried to be cautious but it's hard in that role.
p261_414|it is good for europe.
p261_415|it does not even have a staff shortage.
p261_416|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p261_417|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p261_418|overall the labour market continued to tighten.
p261_419|but a surprise is in store.
p261_420|smoking is also very important.
p261_421|the second goal was superb.
p261_422|we're delighted about the vote.
p261_423|the case will now go to appeal.
p261_424|this market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p261_425|yet the data is compelling.
p261_426|it was important to win the singles.
p261_427|he's had to suffer for the last six years.
p261_428|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p261_429|he was on a horse.
p261_430|well it did last time he was reminded.
p261_431|that's the way it works.
p261_432|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p261_433|it succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p261_434|pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p261_435|he is on the wrong side.
p261_436|by then a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p261_437|it was the climax of the thing.
p261_438|the trial will open today.
p261_439|i'm looking for work in bath and back home in scotland.
p261_440|it will make a huge difference.
p261_441|it is an absolute nonsense.
p261_442|everything in golf is a balance.
p261_443|it is a case of pity for us.
p261_444|gordon is also highly rated.
p261_445|the first game is so important.
p261_446|it's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p261_447|and we might go back.
p261_448|we think a lot of allan mcgregor.
p261_449|he deserves a second chance.
p261_450|you have to see the work.
p261_451|the funding is now there.
p261_452|but we have built a platform for next season.
p261_453|i was embarrassed by it.
p261_454|i rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p261_455|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p261_456|paris is not only young.
p261_457|no one wants to go through these things.
p261_458|our legal advice is clear.
p261_459|it all began as an accident.
p261_460|long term it was the right thing to do.
p261_461|it might be useful to have something in black and white.
p261_462|they were totally behind it.
p261_463|let that be their memorial.
p261_464|nine days later he suffered another attack.
p261_465|she would take the farmer to the opera.
p261_466|the edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p261_467|phil mickelson did that last year.
p261_468|no options are excluded at all.
p261_469|they are defined by law.
p261_470|if that's the case he will struggle.
p261_471|i'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
p261_472|it's been a long long journey.
p261_473|war is not the action.
p261_474|my place is in the kitchen.
p262_001|please call stella.
p262_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p262_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p262_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p262_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p262_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p262_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p262_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p262_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p262_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p262_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p262_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p262_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p262_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p262_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p262_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p262_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p262_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p262_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p262_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p262_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p262_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p262_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p262_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p262_025|the main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p262_026|they should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p262_027|however the following year the cancer returned.
p262_028|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p262_029|we want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p262_030|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p262_031|i expected these kind of questions.
p262_032|this is the window.
p262_033|people love to see this stuff.
p262_034|life was like a timetable.
p262_035|then suddenly they weren't.
p262_036|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p262_037|it was clear.
p262_038|the problem is the pitch.
p262_039|it was ugly.
p262_040|however the decision has been welcomed by scottish enterprise officials.
p262_041|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p262_042|the judge said.
p262_043|it's a crucial award.
p262_044|it is difficult for ali.
p262_045|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p262_046|i was angry.
p262_047|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p262_048|they had to explain it.
p262_049|he had no enemies.
p262_050|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p262_051|next league matches celtic.
p262_052|there would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p262_053|it's very odd.
p262_054|already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p262_055|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p262_056|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p262_057|new york is expected to come to a standstill.
p262_058|jobs could go.
p262_059|and a film maker was born.
p262_060|i fell against him.
p262_061|there was a battle there.
p262_062|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p262_063|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p262_064|he was popular.
p262_065|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p262_066|it is like a river running by my home.
p262_067|i was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p262_068|it's all i can do.
p262_069|he highlighted a lack of staff.
p262_070|then followed a bout of flu.
p262_071|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p262_072|i had my suspicions.
p262_073|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p262_074|i've not thought about it.
p262_075|what has changed?
p262_076|i'd like to continue that record.
p262_077|detection is often difficult.
p262_078|he is driven.
p262_079|all options are open.
p262_080|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p262_081|someone who cares
p262_082|it's never too late.
p262_083|lord levy said he started life with nothing.
p262_084|that will come after the game on saturday.
p262_085|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p262_086|today i couldn't run on it.
p262_087|mr livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p262_088|this is the first big idea of the scottish parliament election.
p262_089|that deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p262_090|then came the crunch.
p262_091|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p262_092|they are now divorced.
p262_093|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p262_094|scotland will have strong defences as part of the united kingdom.
p262_095|for once you should believe the hype.
p262_096|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p262_097|it is a good day for the coalition.
p262_098|however the intensive care unit at the southern general hospital was full.
p262_099|two of the team became ill.
p262_100|oil embargo endorsed.
p262_101|it is a good lifestyle.
p262_102|it was an adventure.
p262_103|it's not perfect.
p262_104|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p262_105|he pleaded for caution.
p262_106|they are ready.
p262_107|it's a shame.
p262_108|naturally it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p262_109|holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p262_110|they were behind the wheel.
p262_111|this film will be totally awesome.
p262_112|mr chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p262_113|until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p262_114|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p262_115|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p262_116|who would have?
p262_117|the whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p262_118|i felt very strongly that england should have it.
p262_119|next season for every manager is a long time away.
p262_120|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p262_121|so the european elections are extremely important.
p262_122|it was the same at twickenham.
p262_123|it plans to return to this field.
p262_124|our intentions are real.
p262_125|the goals were good.
p262_126|yesterday mr hague dismissed the poll.
p262_127|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p262_128|nobody in the world can get away from him.
p262_129|it's a question of fashion.
p262_130|it seems so long since i did the exams.
p262_131|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p262_132|we need to chat.
p262_133|she died at her home.
p262_134|i have a kind of love affair with hollywood.
p262_135|it would be a last resort.
p262_136|that group reported just before christmas.
p262_137|labour's scottish general secretary alex rowley was delighted yesterday.
p262_138|it opens the door to the champions league.
p262_139|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p262_140|it is huge.
p262_141|i've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p262_142|charles gordon leader of glasgow city council declined to comment.
p262_143|last night he was due to hold talks with arafat.
p262_144|mr blair had done well.
p262_145|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p262_146|we should be clear about the role of government.
p262_147|it is a freedom.
p262_148|it's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p262_149|i knew he was good.
p262_150|they were later discharged from hospital.
p262_151|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p262_152|neither side can win this war.
p262_153|he can do no wrong.
p262_154|alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p262_155|a new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p262_156|he's been the key to everything.
p262_157|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p262_158|they say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p262_159|as indeed they would be.
p262_160|they are not advertised.
p262_161|we knew we had the goal we wanted.
p262_162|however the french government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p262_163|it's that sort of night.
p262_164|it is not too late to get on board.
p262_165|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p262_166|we have a budget in march.
p262_167|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p262_168|the post will be unpaid.
p262_169|last weekend in germany he missed the cut.
p262_170|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p262_171|we've made a couple of albums.
p262_172|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p262_173|is saddam a threat?
p262_174|i feel like my game has come a long way.
p262_175|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p262_176|the clarity is vital.
p262_177|jacques chirac the french president was surely in his sights.
p262_178|there is no evidence of a little scotland emerging.
p262_179|that has been the easy part.
p262_180|he will need that machine.
p262_181|nothing is safe.
p262_182|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p262_183|they need to look after themselves.
p262_184|miller was every bit as happy.
p262_185|i had a train to catch.
p262_186|that would be my view.
p262_187|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p262_188|neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p262_189|we must keep our feet on the ground.
p262_190|it wasn't to be.
p262_191|i came home by ambulance.
p262_192|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p262_193|our strategy is straightforward.
p262_194|the group is separate from the real ira.
p262_195|people acted too quickly.
p262_196|the service from the other players was super.
p262_197|he's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p262_198|he has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p262_199|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p262_200|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p262_201|they are in the euro.
p262_202|the album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p262_203|it's all about money money money.
p262_204|there was no rescue.
p262_205|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p262_206|but i am a worried man.
p262_207|there was an e mail.
p262_208|it's a big deal for me.
p262_209|we'll have to work hard today.
p262_210|the proposals are to be debated on monday by city councillors.
p262_211|i had decided to quit the show.
p262_212|the second is the reaction of the hibs fans.
p262_213|i have wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p262_214|he seemed to lose his focus.
p262_215|work has started.
p262_216|his death was a tragic accident.
p262_217|but the military campaign is a military campaign against osama bin laden.
p262_218|it s the real thing for sure.
p262_219|we have not given up hope.
p262_220|the loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p262_221|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p262_222|clearly the stakes are high.
p262_223|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p262_224|the track is currently covered in snow.
p262_225|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p262_226|at the time he was a living legend.
p262_227|the dow jones is way up.
p262_228|however no further action was taken by police.
p262_229|it's that kind of place.
p262_230|but you think i'm going to argue with the big man?
p262_231|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p262_232|it's very safe.
p262_233|a succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p262_234|it is a terrible loss.
p262_235|but it's a subtle process.
p262_236|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p262_237|of further privacy he had no need.
p262_238|he was good but not that good.
p262_239|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p262_240|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p262_241|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p262_242|a change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p262_243|jock brown is appointed as general manager.
p262_244|they may yet have the last laugh.
p262_245|manager bobby williamson has no injury worries.
p262_246|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p262_247|the scene is about this?
p262_248|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p262_249|it is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p262_250|i was shocked.
p262_251|a friendship that will endure.
p262_252|i didn't need to watch it on the video.
p262_253|he said he was impressed by the set up at celtic.
p262_254|i've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p262_255|that could be in place by next year.
p262_256|at the end of the day one has to be careful.
p262_257|we run within the law.
p262_258|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p262_259|this is a big club.
p262_260|the bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p262_261|it will now relate to all public bodies in scotland.
p262_262|i am very angry.
p262_263|i saw one body.
p262_264|at first i thought i was gone.
p262_265|they wanted the club to make money.
p262_266|we shall rely on human beings.
p262_267|immediate action must be taken.
p262_268|it's very nice.
p262_269|he was also married with two children.
p262_270|it was an easy decision to come here.
p262_271|lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p262_272|it's not even finished.
p262_273|things can change.
p262_274|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p262_275|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p262_276|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p262_277|his place in central defence was taken by john anderson.
p262_278|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p262_279|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p262_280|we have to break that cycle.
p262_281|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p262_282|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p262_283|i saw it at a ruck.
p262_284|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p262_285|he will address the nation this evening.
p262_286|the attacker died in the crash.
p262_287|it was a virus.
p262_288|the mood is good.
p262_289|this is a national crisis.
p262_290|the death toll included five children.
p262_291|who did the recruiting?
p262_292|mr campbell received a phone call.
p262_293|it's a lovely lovely film.
p262_294|well he can do it.
p262_295|it shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p262_296|it is a vote of confidence in the skills in scotland.
p262_297|and huge indeed it is.
p262_298|the results are sometimes contentious.
p262_299|it's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p262_300|if you can run a computer you can talk to the world.
p262_301|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p262_302|the move was welcomed by the roman catholic church in scotland.
p262_303|mark fisher was a guest of the northern ireland tourist board.
p262_304|what has altered?
p262_305|within months he was a part time tribunal chairman.
p262_306|one was a lawyer.
p262_307|however the groups denied the claims.
p262_308|they should be swept away.
p262_309|we are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p262_310|it is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p262_311|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p262_312|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p262_313|funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p262_314|the letters are going out today.
p262_315|we want to play at the worlds.
p262_316|is there on his hands?
p262_317|special measures were needed.
p262_318|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p262_319|i never thought it would take this long.
p262_320|in fact they have the opposite effect.
p262_321|we are a peaceful people.
p262_322|it should be equal.
p262_323|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p262_324|the problems began a long time ago.
p262_325|my body is clearly capable.
p262_326|he said she was mad.
p262_327|it is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p262_328|davis is very supportive as a director.
p262_329|we are in the end game.
p262_330|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p262_331|the parents will have a great time too.
p262_332|i am so upset.
p262_333|it shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p262_334|it could have gone either way.
p262_335|he was then replaced by ross.
p262_336|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p262_337|it is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p262_338|the team for the first game could be this one.
p262_339|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p262_340|the scottish prison service said it could not comment on the visit.
p262_341|his views are hardly surprising.
p262_342|i would miss him.
p262_343|it will be very very tight.
p262_344|that is the very reason why it was so vital.
p262_345|it was forced to divert.
p262_346|i could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p262_347|chambers said he would accept the place.
p262_348|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p262_349|a few days after making the video i went to the inquiry.
p262_350|i got a yellow card.
p262_351|there is no link.
p262_352|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p262_353|on the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p262_354|the parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p262_355|a man has since been charged with his murder.
p262_356|it is horrible.
p262_357|the council said the house would have to be demolished.
p262_358|here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p262_359|he's very explosive.
p262_360|it was one in the afternoon.
p262_361|we will be homeless.
p262_362|that would help.
p262_363|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p262_364|it was a double tragedy for the family.
p262_365|we do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p262_366|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p262_367|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p262_368|i am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p262_369|talks are progressing.
p262_370|the eye was badly closed on sunday.
p262_371|it was a funny game.
p262_372|it is a large number.
p262_373|we felt at the moment it was not possible.
p262_374|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p262_375|i am a wealthy person.
p262_376|something is wrong.
p262_377|mentally you have to be tough.
p262_378|i am very happy with life.
p262_379|i was so nervous.
p262_380|we have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p262_381|however it's good to turn the page.
p262_382|it would be a massive boost for them.
p262_383|the release attracted little attention.
p262_384|it was important to win the singles.
p262_385|apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p262_386|we're looking for justice.
p262_387|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p262_388|they are good.
p262_389|it was a breathtaking moment.
p262_390|it was on fire.
p262_391|this is a major step forward for carers.
p262_392|but in fact the reverse is true.
p262_393|emotions were complex.
p262_394|his remarks appear to have had an effect.
p263_001|please call stella.
p263_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p263_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p263_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p263_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p263_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p263_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p263_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p263_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p263_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p263_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p263_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p263_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p263_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p263_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p263_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p263_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p263_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p263_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p263_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p263_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p263_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p263_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p263_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p263_025|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p263_026|how are you sir ?
p263_027|so is that it then ?
p263_028|do i have a favourite ?
p263_029|what do we do ?
p263_030|we would like to find another region to develop in england.
p263_031|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p263_032|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p263_033|allan johnston was not match fit.
p263_034|the idea is not new.
p263_035|i could not do it.
p263_036|life was like a timetable.
p263_037|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p263_038|you have to expect this type of thing.
p263_039|no company would want to put their people at risk.
p263_040|at this stage we think the air campaign is enough.
p263_041|it could well be the case.
p263_042|this work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
p263_043|she is believed to be in south africa.
p263_044|it will come all right.
p263_045|it seemed the tough times were behind him.
p263_046|that company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
p263_047|the yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p263_048|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p263_049|i didn't think any player was a success on saturday.
p263_050|people were determined to change the government in the last election.
p263_051|i would love to have him home.
p263_052|he looks like an afghan.
p263_053|he will need that machine.
p263_054|both banks are heavily involved in the scottish market.
p263_055|already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p263_056|we have not given up hope.
p263_057|it will now take over the running of the estate.
p263_058|i've got to provide for my family.
p263_059|it was bound to happen.
p263_060|four other charges were dropped.
p263_061|we have to keep our clients.
p263_062|indeed it is only the beginning.
p263_063|hopefully we have learned a lot from that game.
p263_064|i am pleased to be in them.
p263_065|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p263_066|but retail banking would be run from halifax.
p263_067|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p263_068|saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p263_069|it is the only way forward for the club.
p263_070|i was very pleased with them today though.
p263_071|it's all i can do.
p263_072|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p263_073|it was nice to get a clean sheet.
p263_074|it is a job creation scheme.
p263_075|thankfully mr campbell was able to help.
p263_076|even the one she loved.
p263_077|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p263_078|so did she meet him ?
p263_079|so what is the campaign about ?
p263_080|and does it ?
p263_081|are you from the rugby ?
p263_082|two israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p263_083|just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p263_084|the insurance company is only interested in your profits.
p263_085|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p263_086|thomson is expected to manage the business.
p263_087|the damage from the fire was huge.
p263_088|a play is a set of actions.
p263_089|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p263_090|scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
p263_091|i expected a victory the pain is enormous.
p263_092|the first few days will determine whether she can survive.
p263_093|the trick is to try it.
p263_094|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p263_095|it might change your life.
p263_096|no one in the passenger train was hurt.
p263_097|mr blair should be warned.
p263_098|you might not make it.
p263_099|officers recovered a second body in the area.
p263_100|however a decision should be made before the end of august.
p263_101|scotland will have strong defences as part of the united kingdom.
p263_102|i did not have a bet on myself.
p263_103|i saw the whole thing.
p263_104|a progress report will be published in october.
p263_105|the investment will be in the food.
p263_106|there is a contract in existence for allan.
p263_107|gordon marshall was outstanding against us.
p263_108|our preference is to play in midweek.
p263_109|you are like an animal.
p263_110|in the end we made too many errors.
p263_111|it has been a nightmare of frustration.
p263_112|that all hope is never lost.
p263_113|it should be a great game though.
p263_114|overall it was a promising day for the scots.
p263_115|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p263_116|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p263_117|he was jailed for a year.
p263_118|it was won on the issue of the land.
p263_119|naturally it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p263_120|the fire was above the hole.
p263_121|pupils will be the losers.
p263_122|the problem was a social problem.
p263_123|such actions are rarely popular.
p263_124|thereafter he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p263_125|it isn't a happy memory.
p263_126|when we played them last year we were beaten by the weather.
p263_127|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p263_128|they've got to account for it.
p263_129|it was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p263_130|it would be great to reward the scottish public with a win.
p263_131|you can spend money on housing.
p263_132|i told him i was a long time ago.
p263_133|they have to come clean.
p263_134|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p263_135|i could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p263_136|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p263_137|it is just a tax on employment.
p263_138|the move has provoked a mixed response.
p263_139|the squad is too small.
p263_140|why change it ?
p263_141|what do we want to do that for ?
p263_142|does the name matter ?
p263_143|how do you get it back ?
p263_144|the temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
p263_145|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p263_146|any success would have been an improvement.
p263_147|losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p263_148|i never wanted a legal battle.
p263_149|and the farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p263_150|next time round it will be different.
p263_151|she died at her home.
p263_152|we have seen a copy of the report.
p263_153|but the commission is on a collision course with the government.
p263_154|it is the quality of the work that counts.
p263_155|check that he is dead.
p263_156|five minutes later the home team were back in front.
p263_157|drugs are used a lot at the fishing not just cannabis.
p263_158|there is no mandate for a regime change.
p263_159|like the others he was arrested.
p263_160|she will do for me.
p263_161|i have had a good life.
p263_162|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p263_163|the departure of mr johnston was reported by the herald yesterday.
p263_164|it is crucial for both teams.
p263_165|however she did not report the matter to the police.
p263_166|nobody in scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
p263_167|one letter from a teacher arrived at christmas.
p263_168|the other businesses were based in yorkshire and northern ireland.
p263_169|i would like to see the figures for the second quarter.
p263_170|neither side can win this war.
p263_171|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p263_172|these days are long gone.
p263_173|it is an attitude of mind.
p263_174|they are expected to appear at edinburgh sheriff court today.
p263_175|eight months later he was dead.
p263_176|worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p263_177|the internet is no substitute for customer service.
p263_178|local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p263_179|so was the first half.
p263_180|you have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p263_181|the decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
p263_182|it's nice to be involved.
p263_183|irvine said his company was intent on supporting the scottish dairy industry.
p263_184|last weekend in germany he missed the cut.
p263_185|waiting times for these services are too long.
p263_186|time is now very short.
p263_187|our position remains the same.
p263_188|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p263_189|the region is open for business.
p263_190|i feel like my game has come a long way.
p263_191|the championship is different from the other majors.
p263_192|it makes no influence on the public.
p263_193|i thought he did very well.
p263_194|says the duke of york.
p263_195|the shooting created panic in the street.
p263_196|equally he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p263_197|it could be done by experts and lawyers.
p263_198|you know the sort of thing.
p263_199|my main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p263_200|we are committed to realising the potential of every child.
p263_201|it is a terrible loss.
p263_202|i think therefore i am ?
p263_203|who was she ?
p263_204|or was it ?
p263_205|and they were being paid ?
p263_206|two years later she was dead.
p263_207|it is not easy to live in russia.
p263_208|it is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
p263_209|however this idea is never developed.
p263_210|we believe the world has too many refugees already.
p263_211|we must keep our feet on the ground.
p263_212|it is hard to tell.
p263_213|he should emerge as the winner.
p263_214|i came home by ambulance.
p263_215|this decision was taken with the full support of scottish ministers.
p263_216|the confidence is low but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p263_217|the early goal was a shock to the system for hearts.
p263_218|indeed he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p263_219|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p263_220|they are in the euro.
p263_221|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p263_222|the defender should have won the bloody ba.
p263_223|a deadline is still essential.
p263_224|we see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p263_225|bombing is the easy option.
p263_226|he added that he was very sad about o neill.
p263_227|abbey national is an option.
p263_228|we can hardly talk about it.
p263_229|it was located on the remote control.
p263_230|it is safe in our hands.
p263_231|i'm just a regular person.
p263_232|i am considered a teenager.
p263_233|in each case they were a goal down.
p263_234|it's just a normal life.
p263_235|he remains a main board director of royal.
p263_236|people should make their own decisions.
p263_237|that you can do it.
p263_238|we will reform the welfare state.
p263_239|it could be to do with the location.
p263_241|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p263_242|she will attend in july.
p263_243|the body follows the mind.
p263_244|i always felt that i was in control of the match.
p263_245|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p263_246|that will be the criteria for the future.
p263_247|i'm so proud to be scottish tonight.
p263_248|we were a load of rubbish.
p263_249|he has run a hell of a race.
p263_250|what was the matter for concern ?
p263_251|do i think about them often ?
p263_252|is it in the right place ?
p263_253|did he trip ?
p263_254|does that put pressure on us ?
p263_255|frankly it was worth the booking.
p263_256|the deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
p263_257|the irony was not lost.
p263_258|three weeks later he resigned.
p263_259|we have a free vote on these things in our party.
p263_260|it might be sad but it's a fact.
p263_261|you look like a rugby player.
p263_262|chairman sir alistair grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p263_263|a change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p263_264|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p263_265|you can feel at home in china.
p263_266|we've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the north east.
p263_267|the whole point is to get the issue into the open.
p263_268|my son was too young to die.
p263_269|it should have taken a year for a company this size.
p263_270|we were not allowed to go to help them.
p263_271|i didn't see the point.
p263_272|it seems a shame to leave it.
p263_273|the advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p263_274|i can't get a job.
p263_275|i've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p263_276|that could be in place by next year.
p263_277|the property is owned by glasgow city council.
p263_278|the distinction is also supported by doctors.
p263_279|they must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p263_280|they must play for each other.
p263_281|the work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p263_282|it is a crisis of human rights a crisis of leadership.
p263_283|they can leave at any time.
p263_284|i was delighted with the way he jumped.
p263_285|much of the equipment was new.
p263_286|you get a lot for your money.
p263_287|an announcement will follow in due course.
p263_288|he has not created a festival resource.
p263_289|he was also married with two children.
p263_291|i was first in the door.
p263_292|access has been a nightmare.
p263_293|further expansion has been achieved in germany and italy.
p263_294|it will always be the highlight of my career.
p263_295|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p263_296|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p263_297|she failed in her action.
p263_298|its body language is all wrong.
p263_299|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p263_300|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p263_301|so the government will be damaged.
p263_302|i have lost all confidence.
p263_303|john was there already in spirit.
p263_304|in the end it was no choice.
p263_305|are they free ?
p263_306|what are they for ?
p263_307|is there a waiting list ?
p263_308|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p263_309|i intended to look for another club on loan.
p263_310|however a ruling will not come before next week.
p263_311|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p263_312|the government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p263_313|i have decided to stand down from the list.
p263_314|clydesdale bank declined to comment.
p263_315|they had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p263_316|but it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p263_317|it's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p263_318|nothing has been put into action.
p263_319|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p263_320|like many companies it is a problem.
p263_321|action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
p263_322|however a bid was never made.
p263_323|we're not an employment agency.
p263_324|i could not have hoped to run at this level.
p263_325|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p263_326|the following year was a miserable time for mr dewar.
p263_327|at the moment it is very difficult to know.
p263_328|they come to enjoy themselves.
p263_329|there's still a bit to go.
p263_330|we have a good healthy debate.
p263_331|funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p263_332|it is a court case.
p263_333|the minister is the engineer.
p263_334|there is no plan b.
p263_335|he will go a long way.
p263_336|the result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p263_337|he has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p263_338|the premier league has been a huge success.
p263_339|there is no other solution to congestion in edinburgh.
p263_340|she is on a life support machine.
p263_341|he is married with three children.
p263_342|ms anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p263_343|it's difficult to predict the future.
p263_344|my body is clearly capable.
p263_345|tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
p263_346|in the old days it was easy.
p263_347|the airport was even different.
p263_348|hopefully he will get a lucky break.
p263_349|it is the same old story.
p263_350|analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
p263_351|overall we are very pleased.
p263_352|it was tough to contain the excitement.
p263_353|does it matter ?
p263_354|how do you take them away ?
p263_355|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p263_356|after the match do you ?
p263_357|the pain was almost too much to bear.
p263_358|whether this return was too soon.
p263_359|there is a good example in this city.
p263_360|on thursday mr blair will address the institute of public policy research.
p263_361|he was then replaced by ross.
p263_362|that's as it should be.
p263_363|the key player in this matter is now the prime minister.
p263_364|it is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p263_365|there is a range of employers.
p263_366|but we welcome this document.
p263_367|he did a good job.
p263_368|they made clear that they are not interested in government assistance.
p263_369|the announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p263_370|the value of the merger is still there.
p263_371|nobody else was with me.
p263_372|she would take the farmer to the opera.
p263_373|they may yet have the last laugh.
p263_374|however the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p263_375|and i repeat it would be for exposure and money.
p263_376|like his acting it was an accident.
p263_377|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p263_378|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p263_379|a report is the first step in a criminal case in india.
p263_380|this view was echoed by the other scottish analyst.
p263_381|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p263_382|they were to blame for the first two goals.
p263_383|the bank was now involved.
p263_384|it was like a weekly wage.
p263_385|scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p263_386|we are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p263_387|but the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p263_388|you have to rely on each other.
p263_389|this season has been a nightmare.
p263_390|i felt the head was very like me.
p263_391|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p263_392|we have to put pressure on rangers.
p263_393|she has a little boy.
p263_394|theatre is not a museum.
p263_395|i was just happy to get my own goal.
p263_396|he later became a respected high court judge.
p263_397|the thing is to recognise that chance.
p263_398|he has been in a nursing home for two years.
p263_399|reaction from scottish business leaders was mixed.
p263_400|they have put in a lot of time and effort.
p263_401|he's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
p263_402|he replied that it was a dilemma.
p263_403|we felt at the moment it was not possible.
p263_404|he said the parliament should be left to make its own decision.
p263_405|man is fully listed on the london stock exchange.
p263_406|we must improve our relations with government.
p263_407|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p263_408|it was an amazing afternoon.
p263_409|the casualties were not named.
p263_410|we shall not be moved.
p263_411|i didn't know that i had a court appearance on wednesday.
p263_412|it looked like a river.
p263_413|the company hopes to repeat the process in france.
p263_414|once again they were back amongst the big boys.
p263_415|it was important to win the singles.
p263_416|i'm pleased about one thing.
p263_417|his ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p263_418|i had a tie in my hand.
p263_419|i can lead by example.
p263_420|such an attack is bizarre.
p263_421|today the story is different.
p263_422|the queen mother is dead.
p263_423|head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p263_424|we have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
p263_425|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p263_426|a police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p263_427|but we are severely limited in funds.
p263_428|together we can make a difference.
p263_429|it is that sort of film.
p263_430|mr reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
p263_431|they recorded their debut album in new york.
p263_432|a new leader is unlikely to be chosen before september.
p263_433|which may be the same thing.
p263_434|it is not a standing army.
p263_435|we know about the crisis in cattle.
p263_436|as it turned out it was a triumph.
p263_437|we shall not forget him.
p263_438|i can't wait for the season to end.
p263_439|it is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p263_440|i was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p263_441|you have got to be careful.
p263_442|there is the beautiful game to write.
p263_443|no decisions have been made in this respect.
p263_444|it wouldn't matter if he had.
p263_445|no because it was too many.
p263_446|he deserves a second chance.
p263_447|i believed that effort was needed in our own area.
p263_448|it is not over by any means.
p263_449|the second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
p263_450|he was convicted at glasgow sheriff court.
p263_451|it is a tough game but we have a chance.
p263_452|but we have built a platform for next season.
p263_453|it looked like a war zone.
p263_454|legal opinion is that i may have a case.
p263_455|however one has arrived in the post.
p263_456|they offer a kind of narrative.
p263_457|he looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
p263_458|he doesn't like the labour party.
p263_459|it goes with the job.
p263_460|it has been a waste of time.
p263_461|the rest of the business is very robust.
p263_462|i saw it didn't work.
p263_463|to tell the truth it wasn't a good game.
p263_464|we are over the moon.
p263_465|it was another reminder of the power of an image.
p263_466|they're just a good retailer.
p263_467|tickets will be at a premium.
p263_468|it's been a long long journey.
p263_469|i just got under the ball a bit.
p263_470|there is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
p263_471|that should get their attention.
p263_472|it's just a place to open it.
p263_473|my place is in the kitchen.
p264_001|please call stella.
p264_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p264_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p264_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p264_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p264_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p264_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p264_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p264_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p264_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p264_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p264_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p264_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p264_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p264_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p264_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p264_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p264_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p264_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p264_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p264_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p264_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p264_025|the west coast line is not just for middle england.
p264_026|i've got the same feeling as i had last week in germany.
p264_027|he does not even trust his own members.
p264_028|we're only taking on a couple just now.
p264_029|the local primary is excellent.
p264_030|do not give your details to anyone.
p264_031|i feel i did not have enough time.
p264_032|he added that her comments were noted.
p264_033|it felt right for me.
p264_034|we are opening an inquiry.
p264_035|this remains the case.
p264_036|certainly we do as well.
p264_037|it carried a double message.
p264_038|it was a total surprise.
p264_039|i wish i could see it again.
p264_040|i am secure in my owns position.
p264_041|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p264_042|it is a complex deal.
p264_043|i made my mind up before we came on tour.
p264_044|it does not stop here.
p264_045|we're working on it night and day.
p264_046|the head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p264_047|the results out tomorrow will focus on the company's strategy.
p264_048|there remains some scottish influence however.
p264_049|i only signed this morning.
p264_050|the office is a show about nothing then.
p264_051|we were leading by two goals.
p264_053|it was dangerous but vital employment.
p264_054|all options are available.
p264_055|how are you sir?
p264_056|so is that it then?
p264_057|do i have a favourite?
p264_058|what do we do?
p264_059|why do it otherwise?
p264_060|what kind of man does that mr dick?
p264_061|so did she meet him?
p264_062|it happens from time to time.
p264_063|you could very well be.
p264_064|people come to see the highlands.
p264_065|it is nice to be a woman and a wife.
p264_066|she always put the party first.
p264_067|things have just worked out this way.
p264_068|that is not possible.
p264_069|this is far too high.
p264_070|he has real potential.
p264_071|but i had never been in a theatre.
p264_072|without doubt the debate on education is welcome.
p264_073|confidence is as low as it can get.
p264_074|i think with my experience i can help the team.
p264_075|that is really all.
p264_076|the deal was done on wednesday.
p264_077|the time has arrived for a review.
p264_078|that is very important.
p264_079|only water is currently allowed.
p264_080|put simply it goes something like this.
p264_081|over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p264_082|it looks that way.
p264_083|now comes the hard part.
p264_084|maybe they will see sense.
p264_085|we're at home which is important.
p264_086|because i was a very physical person.
p264_087|the circumstances have changed since last year.
p264_088|they're already booked for next year.
p264_089|the savings can be dramatic.
p264_090|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p264_091|they are a different team at home.
p264_092|however this weekend it will be different.
p264_093|are you going to win?
p264_094|what is the wife?
p264_096|what do we want to do that for?
p264_097|does the name matter?
p264_098|how do you get it back?
p264_099|what are you not good at?
p264_100|his massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.
p264_101|two of our crew were killed.
p264_102|i feel confident about the outcome.
p264_103|the referee had been right.
p264_104|jack was always going to win this one.
p264_105|it would be easy to think so.
p264_106|you're quite wrong he said.
p264_107|i was born for this moment.
p264_108|i first met him last summer.
p264_109|the newspapers by contrast had held their value.
p264_110|you can maintain regular contact.
p264_112|this makes up for it.
p264_113|firm action must be taken.
p264_114|but they had to be paid for.
p264_115|that's the bit that's wrong.
p264_116|nothing would now surprise me.
p264_117|therefore no one can work full time in these companies.
p264_118|but i am in practice.
p264_119|trading is tough at the moment.
p264_120|it came a bit late.
p264_121|all music goes into me.
p264_122|that was a great performance by the team.
p264_123|it seemed like four hours.
p264_124|the family moved around a lot.
p264_125|we beat the welsh team.
p264_126|an announcement is expected within a few months.
p264_127|we have a team to reach the final.
p264_128|eight others have followed.
p264_129|these people were my friends.
p264_130|that will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p264_131|it's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p264_132|this commitment should be built upon.
p264_133|i hope we've reached the bottom now.
p264_134|this man could yet win over scottish hearts.
p264_135|domestic orders have also fallen since january.
p264_136|however it's possible that dick can have influence some dutch players to go there.
p264_137|this is a separate announcement which is in a different league.
p264_138|it's very dangerous for markets.
p264_139|he said some things which were better left alone.
p264_140|he nearly killed my son.
p264_141|that comes at a cost.
p264_142|therefore this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p264_143|i told them during their morning break.
p264_144|the eye was badly closed on sunday.
p264_145|the truth will come out.
p264_146|mr dewar understood that.
p264_147|she's been shot.
p264_148|do i think about them often?
p264_149|is it in the right place?
p264_150|did he trip?
p264_151|does that put pressure on us?
p264_152|did it work?
p264_153|their moment had come or so they said.
p264_154|he plans to call for an aid package from mr macdonald.
p264_155|the second failed completely.
p264_156|it gives a commitment.
p264_157|now it was britain's turn.
p264_158|we have come a long way since then.
p264_159|sport is good for you.
p264_160|it was clearly not a battle.
p264_161|no such meeting took place.
p264_162|it is just too tough.
p264_163|there is no doubt there's room for us.
p264_164|the options seem limited.
p264_165|it's been my life.
p264_166|royal bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p264_167|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p264_168|everything people said about it was true.
p264_169|i've no idea how it works.
p264_170|no but my wife is.
p264_171|it is a large number.
p264_172|i'm taking each day as it comes.
p264_173|art can challenge our value system.
p264_174|now he's back on top again.
p264_176|no one wants to talk about death.
p264_177|once again he refused.
p264_178|we just want this session to end.
p264_179|you can spend money on housing.
p264_180|i've never had a year like this.
p264_181|neil has worked hard throughout his career.
p264_182|he is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p264_183|we knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p264_184|she really suffered for her art.
p264_185|the single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.
p264_186|she runs like her mother.
p264_187|i remember that day well.
p264_188|in short the national team without frank is like football without feet.
p264_189|they were certainly tough but totally fair.
p264_190|the questions came quick and fast.
p264_191|we tried four banks.
p264_192|is there a waiting list?
p264_193|do they think anyone else wants them?
p264_194|so what happens next?
p264_195|had this been common practice?
p264_196|what do they want us to do?
p264_197|is it worth it?
p264_198|does it matter?
p264_199|how do you take them away?
p264_200|at half time he was presented to both teams.
p264_201|scotland will not vote for new labour next time.
p264_202|i was independent but i am not now.
p264_203|that first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p264_204|people elsewhere in scotland will feel cut off by this.
p264_205|i saw people on fire.
p264_206|this takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p264_207|both leaders were joined by senior party figures.
p264_208|her experience is certainly limited.
p264_209|the labour side has developed in the north area.
p264_210|he suffered severe head injuries.
p264_211|he was a home referee.
p264_212|brian was last to join.
p264_213|it was men against boys.
p264_214|three hit the target.
p264_215|that could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p264_216|henry should go now.
p264_217|now we have fresh hope.
p264_218|life is still very tough for them.
p264_219|it was a piece of art.
p264_221|britain will be little affected.
p264_222|the two companies were not for sale.
p264_223|it has been a tough year for scottish business.
p264_224|it was all great training.
p264_226|no partners would lose their jobs.
p264_227|i was in daily contact.
p264_228|he talks too much.
p264_230|many changes are positive changes.
p264_231|this is absolutely not true.
p264_232|wall street provided the british market with little fresh direction.
p264_233|it was a great evening.
p264_234|however there is an issue isn't there?
p264_235|after the match do you?
p264_236|has the conflict started?
p264_237|have i really come to this?
p264_238|why do you want to come to edinburgh?
p264_241|he has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p264_242|they are expected to appear at edinburgh sheriff court today.
p264_243|eight months later he was dead.
p264_244|the question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p264_245|i go home only once.
p264_246|it is based on population rather than need.
p264_247|progress however is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.
p264_248|they were game but not very good.
p264_249|i did not vote either way.
p264_250|we really are a team.
p264_251|i hit you there.
p264_252|the pension levels will remain the same.
p264_253|he is keen to stay in public service.
p264_254|for that reason cover should not be given.
p264_255|he felt too close to head office.
p264_256|we have brought the staff back on board.
p264_257|we had a right to expect those days were over.
p264_258|the group's increasing scale will help.
p264_259|we were looking for a base.
p264_260|we had a grand view.
p264_261|walker declined to put a figure on losses.
p264_262|they made such decisions in london.
p264_263|the proposal was rejected.
p264_264|this term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p264_265|some changes have been achieved at great cost.
p264_266|everyone wanted him to win.
p264_267|i was totally wrong.
p264_268|i may play with two players up maybe not.
p264_269|others get through it.
p264_270|i knew him well.
p264_271|i see no reason to doubt that the situation in scotland is any different.
p264_272|all films open tomorrow
p264_273|if i didn't go for the world record i'd feel guilty.
p264_274|the third has yet to be named.
p264_275|he was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.
p264_276|scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.
p264_277|people realise we have a job to do.
p264_278|i'm interested in interesting work.
p264_279|it would be nice to be involved in another victory.
p264_280|sales will begin by the end of october.
p264_281|he will get his chances.
p264_282|friday night was a pretty good night.
p264_283|she now lives in london.
p264_284|it's not a small step.
p264_285|they have the cash and the fire power.
p264_286|the institute board will take the decision.
p264_287|he followed the italian route.
p264_288|if not a deal could take many months.
p264_289|you have made your point.
p264_290|he died the following year.
p264_291|we must move on.
p264_292|it's just an area of water.
p264_293|rangers was on the agenda and i am interested.
p264_294|if so we want to hear from them.
p264_295|she doesn't know the half of it.
p264_296|perhaps they were right.
p264_297|autumn will be a real challenge.
p264_298|many events are down on numbers.
p264_299|he had served his time.
p264_300|that was around july august.
p264_301|the direct effects on trade will be limited.
p264_302|it changed the very language.
p264_303|it was finally agreed on saturday.
p264_304|i did so making the positive case for scottish new labour.
p264_305|only one got through.
p264_306|he remains a main board director of royal.
p264_307|it's not a marketing scheme.
p264_308|there was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p264_309|five years ago its return was rejected.
p264_310|he left pretty quickly.
p264_311|the board would report to the scottish parliament.
p264_312|they might surprise themselves.
p264_313|it is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.
p264_314|hibs are playing with style now.
p264_315|such a policy is for long term strength.
p264_316|this is extremely positive news.
p264_317|other teams moved up too.
p264_318|i just felt like a dead loss.
p264_319|not one person spoke badly.
p264_320|the performance continues to improve.
p264_321|we want immediate action.
p264_322|our relationship has been very good.
p264_323|someone should tell them.
p264_324|they really had a go at us.
p264_325|they should try to get tickets.
p264_326|the change could come as soon as september.
p264_327|they emerged before the patients left hospital.
p264_328|he did not say that.
p264_329|we are a husband and wife team.
p264_330|i can't get away from it.
p264_331|he had played very well.
p264_332|sources yesterday said the royal bank has declined to back him.
p264_333|that will be a decision for bbc scotland.
p264_334|i saw one man vote five times.
p264_335|it's quite crucial for me.
p264_336|this fact is supported by audience research.
p264_337|the regional government faces key elections next may.
p264_339|time remains to put other candidates forward.
p264_340|in great britain it has a life of its own.
p264_341|this deal is a great boost for the borders.
p264_342|an opera company needs to have its orchestra.
p264_343|the european elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p264_344|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p264_345|i believe they are dead.
p264_346|we have no information on iraq.
p264_347|we had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.
p264_348|it looks at public interest issues.
p264_349|the book is closed.
p264_350|i would be very keen on a move to italy.
p264_351|he is fully fit.
p264_352|that would concern me lot.
p264_353|it's clearly a budget.
p264_354|both watched her win yesterday.
p264_355|her father had died recently.
p264_356|we accept the new rules.
p264_357|neil knows the score.
p264_358|he could still be president.
p264_359|it had been introduced over six years.
p264_360|blair is very positive at european councils.
p264_361|it shows we're not much of a rugby country.
p264_362|her body has never been found.
p264_363|the purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.
p264_364|they had to have hospital treatment.
p264_365|i would never even consider it.
p264_366|five local people were injured.
p264_367|it has helped focus attention on junior golf.
p264_368|we've had some pretty bad times.
p264_369|that is for white people.
p264_370|neither had any other career.
p264_371|without rules the elections could not go ahead he stressed.
p264_372|i took my chance.
p264_373|it has the potential to be another north sea.
p264_374|it was exactly four months away.
p264_375|we have a high quality product.
p264_376|he was always scottish labour or simply labour.
p264_377|it would have to look for outside funding.
p264_378|john gave up everything to be with me.
p264_379|he had wanted to play but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.
p264_380|i have been going through a lot of things.
p264_381|people could have a post box in the local post office.
p264_382|if we get a penalty next week i want to take it.
p264_383|this is too much like scotland.
p264_385|his third child was born in april.
p264_386|they want the style of the sound changed a bit.
p264_387|young people will always run away.
p264_388|the view is impressive.
p264_389|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p264_390|it is the same with barry.
p264_391|the experts got it wrong.
p264_392|we have done our own tests.
p264_393|no because they look good boys.
p264_394|his deal is effective for two years starting in july.
p264_395|we learned two things.
p264_396|it has been only average.
p264_397|it was either wednesday or thursday he said.
p264_398|it was an attitude thing.
p264_399|but it is her picture.
p264_400|the tickets are on their way.
p264_401|he plays only for himself.
p264_402|they have quick front players but so do we.
p264_403|we will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p264_404|it was that kind of match.
p264_405|good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.
p264_406|the songs are just so good.
p264_407|so i moved on.
p264_408|that view was confirmed by welsh coach graham henry.
p264_409|you took the law into your own hands.
p264_410|but british scientists were not convinced by the findings.
p264_411|they like big name players.
p264_412|financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.
p264_413|williams said the same.
p264_414|i was the sheep.
p264_415|i've learned a huge amount from michael.
p264_416|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p264_417|a report will be issued by march.
p264_418|the legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.
p264_419|we didn't really have to power up.
p264_420|he is very fast all right.
p264_421|they could change them tomorrow.
p264_422|we have some options there.
p264_423|this man must be helped to keep his arm.
p264_424|our performance wasn't perfect.
p264_425|those overseas offices were great.
p264_426|she had black eyes.
p264_427|in practice the economic tests have to be met.
p264_428|i have to protect them.
p264_429|the people are nice though.
p264_430|equipment is also a problem.
p264_431|we cannot ask for them back.
p264_432|the tie isn't over.
p264_433|he doesn't need to hit people.
p264_434|a job is a job after all.
p264_435|it all came good.
p264_436|it was a hard fight.
p264_437|special measures were needed.
p264_438|however the proposal is not aimed at rugby but at all sports.
p264_439|colin cameron was excellent.
p264_440|that approach has passed its sell by date.
p264_441|sir george said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.
p264_442|we all watch the same match.
p264_443|we would deal first with the biggest party.
p264_444|the company was set up six years ago.
p264_445|it was an outstanding performance.
p264_446|the three previous winners also came from scotland.
p264_447|in the old days it was easy.
p264_448|powers looks straight ahead.

p264_450|we are unable to provide support for future issues.
p264_451|these days are past.
p264_452|the official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.
p264_453|they finished second and third.
p264_454|he was then replaced by ross.
p264_455|they thought he was asking the right questions.
p264_456|it had been accepted.
p264_457|the truth was rather different.
p264_458|the technology looks excellent.
p264_459|the party had high hopes of taking the seat from labour.
p264_460|we have very limited capacity.
p264_461|in general terms the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p264_462|they're interested only in profits.
p264_463|that does not take much training.
p264_464|scotland needs this award.
p264_465|he enjoyed being with his family.
p264_466|it's a strategy which would work beyond this show.
p264_467|this is a big advantage.
p264_468|he dismissed the action.
p264_469|if they gave me free electricity i still wouldn't support the plans.
p264_470|it is an industry failure.
p264_471|each year they cut them down a bit.
p264_472|we showed some spirit against newcastle.
p264_473|it's a tough old job to get for your first job.
p264_474|i've got to win here to be happy.

p264_479|we were given a break.

p264_481|the parties include the scottish executive.
p264_482|i'd like my tv programmes to be simple but not too simple.
p264_483|your bank may offer you a choice of options.
p264_484|that is surely worth a try.
p264_485|i believe in theatre.
p264_486|the accident seemed so simple.
p264_487|her father wasn't best pleased.
p264_488|just look at his fashion sense.
p264_489|that time may never be broken.
p264_490|we've got good options.
p264_491|this operation will change her life.
p264_492|new york is my home.
p264_493|he added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.
p264_494|that means a ban on french products.
p264_495|this is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.
p265_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p265_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p265_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p265_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p265_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p265_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p265_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p265_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p265_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p265_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p265_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p265_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p265_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p265_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p265_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p265_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p265_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p265_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p265_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p265_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p265_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p265_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p265_025|is this accurate?
p265_026|however the following year the cancer returned.
p265_027|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p265_028|this is the window.
p265_029|we speak about the performance.
p265_030|it's a fact.
p265_031|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p265_032|it has failed.
p265_033|it was clear.
p265_034|a quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p265_035|indeed he does.
p265_036|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p265_037|dancing was her life.
p265_038|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p265_039|it's the only thing.
p265_040|this represents a tough game for us.
p265_041|a neighbour said.
p265_042|among them are many criminals.
p265_043|she looked so young.
p265_044|this is a club on the rise.
p265_045|i guess i was lucky though.
p265_046|there was no safety net.
p265_047|it is unique.
p265_048|i expect a rapid response.
p265_049|today it begins.
p265_050|lancashire police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p265_051|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p265_052|it's that kind of place.
p265_053|they are real.
p265_054|i've spent a lot of time on buses.

p265_059|robin williams is very subdued.
p265_060|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p265_061|a parliament for england is the only way to redress the balance.
p265_063|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p265_064|neither it is.
p265_065|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p265_066|is there a new way forward?
p265_067|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p265_068|the results are tragic.
p265_069|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p265_070|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p265_071|what has changed?
p265_072|he liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p265_073|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p265_074|a play is a set of actions.
p265_075|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p265_076|by then he was walking on water.
p265_077|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p265_078|they lived for their children.
p265_079|it will be tight.
p265_080|the city council is a major property owner in the area.

p265_082|it is a lifeline.
p265_083|maloney is an engaging talent.
p265_084|i have every confidence in raymond robertson as chairman of the party.
p265_085|this one did.
p265_086|they are now divorced.
p265_087|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p265_088|i saw the whole thing.
p265_089|it was mayhem.
p265_090|journalists should make him.
p265_091|it is a love affair.
p265_092|however the intensive care unit at the southern general hospital was full.
p265_093|may not have been at fault?
p265_094|they tried to deny it.
p265_095|we have an election in eight days.
p265_096|oil embargo endorsed.
p265_097|he takes the job.
p265_098|she reflects a bit.
p265_099|now though he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p265_100|the cause of the fire is not yet known.
p265_101|i was just appalled at the way they behaved.

p265_108|it is rubbish.
p265_109|who would be a referee?
p265_110|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.

p265_119|they took a risk.
p265_120|we work well together.
p265_121|what will happen then?
p265_122|the judges will give a ruling next wednesday.
p265_123|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p265_124|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p265_125|is that it?
p265_126|it is a time bomb.
p265_127|i was dead.
p265_128|i don't know the full story.
p265_129|it seems so long since i did the exams.
p265_130|and the farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p265_131|she died at her home.
p265_132|he realises his mistake.
p265_133|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p265_134|the idea is simple.
p265_135|that group reported just before christmas.
p265_136|he sets the nature of his parliament in a simple realistic context.
p265_137|labour's scottish general secretary alex rowley was delighted yesterday.

p265_141|the departure of mr johnston was reported by the herald yesterday.
p265_142|they have not been named.
p265_143|we are now up against it.
p265_144|we are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p265_145|he then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p265_146|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p265_147|well he should know.
p265_148|i will tell you.
p265_149|i've put my own money into this project.
p265_150|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p265_151|she is an expert on medical ethics.
p265_152|it has to be now.
p265_153|military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p265_154|it is not like us.
p265_155|seven people were later detained by police.
p265_156|by then however both men were already in the us.
p265_157|they will do their own thing.
p265_158|you had to go and see him.
p265_159|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p265_160|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p265_161|mr blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p265_162|blair's response was weak.
p265_163|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p265_164|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p265_165|it is not either national standards or local control.
p265_166|he deserved the win.
p265_167|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p265_168|almost the day after the election the battle lines were drawn.
p265_169|they know no other way.
p265_170|i've been there.
p265_171|it's an idea.
p265_172|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p265_173|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p265_174|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p265_175|they need to look after themselves.
p265_176|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p265_177|does this matter?
p265_178|one was a lawyer.
p265_179|i put the drawing down.
p265_180|any change would be subject to the scottish parliament's approval.
p265_181|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p265_182|but a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p265_183|it is a farce.
p265_184|peace was won.
p265_185|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p265_186|it was very frightened and dirty.
p265_187|is that success?
p265_188|the service from the other players was super.
p265_189|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p265_190|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p265_191|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p265_192|the tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p265_193|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p265_194|it's all about money money money.
p265_195|it was worth a photograph.
p265_196|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p265_197|i don't want to use it.
p265_198|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p265_199|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p265_200|i had decided to quit the show.
p265_201|people must remain vigilant.
p265_202|so far the scheme has not been used in scotland.
p265_203|he seemed to lose his focus.
p265_204|i might come back.
p265_205|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p265_206|he said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p265_207|because they didn't want to know.
p265_208|that has been the easy part.
p265_209|but she was.
p265_210|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p265_211|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p265_212|i'd never seen a play about me.
p265_213|it's not before time.
p265_214|the report is due out next month.
p265_215|i am very sorry that alastair campbell has taken this decision.
p265_216|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p265_217|at the time he was a living legend.
p265_218|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p265_219|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p265_220|we were awful.
p265_221|we are so proud.
p265_222|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p265_223|i can leave at the end of the day.
p265_224|until they came to do it.
p265_225|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p265_226|wealth is relative.
p265_227|well they were the unlucky ones.
p265_228|you should be.
p265_229|it's quite nice.
p265_230|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p265_231|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p265_232|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p265_233|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p265_234|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p265_235|hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p265_236|i was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p265_237|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p265_238|we will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p265_239|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p265_240|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p265_241|it was a hit.
p265_242|there's the mix.
p265_243|the government in westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p265_244|i've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p265_245|that could be in place by next year.
p265_246|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p265_247|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p265_248|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p265_249|chelsea was a great club.
p265_250|we have to expand.
p265_251|it is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p265_252|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p265_253|treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p265_254|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p265_255|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p265_256|souter will be back.
p265_257|i am just trying to do my job.
p265_258|blood samples were taken.
p265_259|they want to shut the scottish office.
p265_260|this is a question of islam.
p265_262|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p265_263|it's a way of life.
p265_264|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p265_265|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p265_266|they seem to get away with it.
p265_267|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p265_268|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p265_269|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p265_270|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p265_271|we have to break that cycle.
p265_272|he looked very sharp.
p265_273|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p265_274|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p265_275|you've got to have both sides.
p265_276|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p265_277|dialogue is the key.
p265_278|it was a virus.
p265_279|yet it worked.
p265_280|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p265_281|this is a national crisis.
p265_282|who did the recruiting?
p265_283|so i did.
p265_284|we are not going to forget.
p265_285|what has altered?
p265_286|the award to senator mitchell was announced by the foreign office.
p265_287|there is no openness.
p265_288|i can live with it.
p265_289|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p265_290|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p265_291|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p265_292|last night was a key episode.
p265_293|it wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p265_294|you are the glory.
p265_295|the minister is the engineer.
p265_296|the letters are going out today.
p265_297|surely if anything it would be the other way around.
p265_298|is there on his hands?
p265_299|we are a peaceful people.
p265_300|kids are terrible.
p265_301|horses are drawn by ballot.
p265_302|my body is clearly capable.
p265_303|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p265_304|they had a confession.
p265_305|it will work.
p265_306|i came into this world with nothing.
p265_307|it's too horrible to think.
p265_308|either team will be hard.
p265_309|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p265_310|my view has now completely changed.
p265_311|the party is up for it.
p265_312|is that an issue?
p265_313|finally he paid for the movie.
p265_314|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p265_315|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p265_316|who will do it?
p265_317|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p265_318|locally too the mp is under fire.
p265_319|two people were interviewed.
p265_320|i'm very lucky.
p265_321|it's very good.
p265_322|this is a friendly match?
p265_323|i would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p265_324|they should take their mobile phones.
p265_325|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p265_326|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p265_327|tell us about it.
p265_328|she said they would appeal.
p265_329|but we finished the show.
p265_330|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p265_331|there is no excuse.
p265_332|the scottish parliament should set an example for westminster to follow.
p265_333|the pair are very much in love.
p265_334|as indeed they would be.
p265_335|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p265_336|instead he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p265_337|the shareholders will vote to wind up the company on friday morning.
p265_338|that would help.
p265_339|mr anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p265_340|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p265_341|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p265_342|there was a substantial explosion.
p265_343|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p265_344|he could face a jail sentence.
p265_345|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p265_346|it's been hard.
p265_347|the final decision was between scotland and the republic of ireland.
p265_348|a review is under way.
p265_349|safety was also an issue.
p265_350|so there we won.
p265_351|he was the architect.
p265_352|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p266_001|please call stella.
p266_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p266_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p266_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p266_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p266_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p266_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p266_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p266_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p266_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p266_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p266_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p266_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p266_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p266_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p266_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p266_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p266_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p266_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p266_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p266_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p266_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p266_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p266_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p266_025|she looked so young.
p266_026|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.

p266_082|he is driven.
p266_083|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p266_084|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.

p266_124|there were no grounds for his action.
p266_125|i'm so angry.
p266_126|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p266_127|i was on a roll.
p266_128|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.

p266_153|the departure of mr johnston was reported by the herald yesterday.

p266_169|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p266_170|by then however both men were already in the us.
p266_171|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p266_172|she said she would not welcome the flowers.
p266_173|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p266_174|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p266_175|one season they might do well.
p266_176|is saddam a threat?
p266_177|as we worked.
p266_178|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p266_179|i'm just going to hit the shot.
p266_180|almost the day after the election the battle lines were drawn.
p266_181|i've been there.
p266_182|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p266_183|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p266_184|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p266_186|what has caused the demise of singing?
p266_187|our team is just so young.
p266_188|o neill has delivered.
p266_189|treasury spokesman malcolm bruce is also considered a potential contender.

p266_199|the album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p266_200|it's just awful.
p266_201|it's all about money money money.
p266_202|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p266_203|he knows a lot.
p266_204|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p266_205|it had all been arranged.
p266_206|it's not before time.
p266_207|so far the scheme has not been used in scotland.
p266_208|we want to keep the pound.
p266_209|i was so nervous.
p266_210|he seemed to lose his focus.
p266_211|work has started.
p266_212|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p266_213|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p266_214|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p266_215|during the communist time they were very privileged.
p266_216|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p266_217|saturday is gone.
p266_218|because they didn't want to know.
p266_219|the loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p266_220|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p266_221|clearly the stakes are high.
p266_222|i will win.
p266_223|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p266_224|the report is due out next month.
p266_225|we were awful.
p266_226|they tried to give her advice.
p266_227|they have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
p266_228|they will be stopped and they will be punished.
p266_229|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p266_230|there is no excuse.
p266_231|it's quite nice.
p266_232|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p266_233|of further privacy he had no need.
p266_234|it's a killer piece.
p266_235|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p266_236|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p266_237|it is hard won.
p266_238|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p266_239|you can feel at home in china.
p266_240|the scene is about this?
p266_241|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p266_242|we will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p266_243|my son was too young to die.
p266_244|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p266_245|i should think so too.
p266_246|it was a hit.
p266_247|there's the mix.
p266_248|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p266_249|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p266_250|we are in a war.
p266_251|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p266_252|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p266_253|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p266_254|it was like the old days.
p266_255|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p266_256|chelsea was a great club.
p266_257|it will now relate to all public bodies in scotland.
p266_258|we have to expand.
p266_259|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p266_260|souter will be back.
p266_261|note the date.
p266_262|it will be done in stages.
p266_263|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p266_264|you take a risk.
p266_265|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p266_266|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p266_267|he was also married with two children.
p266_268|the system can work.
p266_269|we do not want any terrorist attacks on any israeli civilians.
p266_270|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p266_271|we're in shock.
p266_272|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p266_273|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p266_274|that goes back a long way.
p266_275|it was very fast.
p266_276|she failed in her action.
p266_277|he promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p266_278|they seem to get away with it.
p266_279|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p266_280|it's so awful.
p266_281|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p266_282|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p266_283|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p266_284|domestic disturbance is currently on general release.
p266_285|dialogue is the key.
p266_286|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p266_287|tony blair said as little.
p266_288|she is an expert on medical ethics.
p266_289|it was good.
p266_290|who did the recruiting?
p266_291|bombing slaughter rejected
p266_292|it came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p266_293|it could well be military.
p266_294|no briton has ever won.
p266_295|robin williams is very subdued.
p266_296|spent three months alone at sea.
p266_297|he added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p266_298|there was a vacuum.
p266_299|we lost a boy.
p266_300|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p266_301|i was brought up in a mining background.
p266_302|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p266_303|within months he was a part time tribunal chairman.
p266_304|the award to senator mitchell was announced by the foreign office.
p266_305|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p266_306|i can give no comment.
p266_307|but the military campaign is a military campaign against osama bin laden.
p266_308|this is a war over our home.
p266_309|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p266_310|the plot is minimal.
p266_311|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p266_312|you should be.
p266_313|the minister is the engineer.
p266_314|i will not allow the destruction of the scottish fishing industry.
p266_315|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p266_316|your father was a good man.
p266_317|we are a peaceful people.
p266_318|you may have a short memory.
p266_319|the problems began a long time ago.
p266_320|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p266_321|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p266_322|a review is under way.
p266_323|we are in the end game.
p266_324|it's too horrible to think.
p266_325|the airport was even different.
p266_326|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p266_327|there was no time scale.
p266_328|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p266_329|is there a new way forward?
p266_330|on thursday mr blair will address the institute of public policy research.
p266_331|finally he paid for the movie.
p266_332|however they will only be found in the wild.
p266_333|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p266_334|who will do it?
p266_335|locally too the mp is under fire.
p266_336|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p266_337|two people were interviewed.
p266_338|we've tried every other way.
p266_339|this is a big advantage.
p266_340|maloney was asked.
p266_341|but i was knocked out by the city.
p266_342|went on sale.
p266_343|i'm very lucky.
p266_344|yet for my money he was not the man of the match.
p266_345|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p266_346|it is long gone.
p266_347|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p266_348|tell us about it.
p266_349|there may be reasons for it.
p266_350|i believe the gap is nearly there.
p266_351|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p266_352|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p266_353|she is free.
p266_354|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p266_355|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p266_356|yet he left a few days later.
p266_357|you have to rely on each other.
p266_358|it was one in the afternoon.
p266_359|we will be homeless.
p266_360|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p266_361|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p266_362|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p266_363|this is a club on the rise.
p266_364|not so it seems.
p266_365|he was also a great man.
p266_366|he could make it.
p266_367|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p266_368|he has been in a nursing home for two years.
p266_369|it's now down in black and white.
p266_370|twaddle is a case in point.
p266_371|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p266_372|it is a simple equation.
p266_373|so there we won.
p266_374|but i managed.
p266_375|by that time however it was already too late.
p266_376|there is no signature.
p266_377|the task is enormous.
p266_378|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p266_379|i am a wealthy person.
p266_380|colour was at the core of his life.
p266_381|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p266_382|of course we will need to strengthen the squad for europe.
p266_384|it's like a car crash.
p266_385|since then he has played no active part in the company.
p266_386|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p266_387|building an underground for example has proved a nightmare.
p266_388|does that put pressure on us?
p266_389|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p266_390|it is unusual.
p266_391|in time may prove a worthy successor to billy dodds.
p266_392|a parliament for england is the only way to redress the balance.
p266_393|well it did last time he was reminded.
p266_394|they are good.
p266_395|he repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p266_396|it was a breathtaking moment.
p266_397|so in a sense it was a government subsidy.
p266_398|what happened in the summer?
p266_399|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p266_400|but in fact the reverse is true.
p266_401|emotions were complex.
p266_402|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p266_403|so i did.
p266_404|it's an absolute nonsense.
p266_405|i knew the script.
p266_406|they were kept there for a summer.
p266_407|the weekly average was three hours.
p266_408|relief was beyond belief.
p266_409|quality meat scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p266_410|he got his degree.
p266_411|the visual arts committee took this decision in december.
p266_412|in that case we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p266_413|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p266_414|but we finished the show.
p266_415|he was really great.
p266_416|senior management in scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p266_417|the shareholders will vote to wind up the company on friday morning.
p266_418|that may be.
p266_419|it is legally binding.
p266_420|paris is not only young.
p266_421|such as it is.
p266_422|it looked like a war zone.
p266_423|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p266_424|i chose to make a film.
p267_001|please call stella.
p267_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p267_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p267_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p267_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p267_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p267_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p267_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p267_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p267_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p267_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p267_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p267_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p267_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p267_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p267_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p267_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p267_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p267_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p267_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p267_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p267_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super imposition of a number of bows.
p267_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p267_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p267_025|a shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p267_026|he may not need to force that message.
p267_027|there is no reason at all.
p267_028|suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p267_029|because we do not need it.
p267_030|we will look into it.
p267_031|this is a central issue.
p267_032|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p267_033|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p267_034|i became a widow overnight.
p267_035|you must always attempt to raise the bar.

p267_043|everything else is a bonus.
p267_044|this is the interesting part.
p267_045|i guess i was lucky though.
p267_046|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p267_047|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p267_048|there was no safety net.
p267_049|they just thought it was extremely good acting.
p267_050|it is a different animal.
p267_051|the city welcomed the brighter outlook.
p267_052|i must take a seat.
p267_053|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p267_054|four other charges were dropped.
p267_055|so i liked the challenge.
p267_056|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p267_057|that way i won't have to do anything.
p267_058|it's just the timing of the game.
p267_059|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p267_060|we need to increase the membership.
p267_061|he was at home with his pals.

p267_064|how are you sir ?
p267_065|so is that it then ?

p267_076|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p267_077|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p267_078|he can win every week.
p267_079|by then he was walking on water.
p267_080|it's so hard to shift.
p267_081|they lived for their children.
p267_082|the cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p267_083|there was no way back for united after that.
p267_084|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p267_085|that deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p267_086|they need to find a form of words.
p267_087|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p267_088|it's for that reason he should resign.
p267_089|the rescue package is public money.
p267_090|before the game we went for a pint.
p267_091|our house was very small.
p267_092|they were a lovely couple.
p267_093|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p267_094|it's not a lack of effort.
p267_095|that means an extra two years.
p267_096|then came the collision with sergio.
p267_097|it is a total and utter change of culture.
p267_098|sport is good for you.
p267_099|we need to handle it.
p267_100|they will notice a difference.

p267_103|he has done that with a great deal to spare.
p267_104|then again we could have.
p267_105|she's got to say something.
p267_106|i was always a little behind.
p267_107|there were no grounds for his action.
p267_108|that admission is not surprising.

p267_122|my conscience is not clear.
p267_123|nobody in the world can get away from him.
p267_124|it would make a lot of sense.
p267_125|they could use a boost.
p267_126|he felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p267_127|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p267_128|they scored with a penalty and a breakaway.

p267_133|it was a piece of art.

p267_154|as indeed they would be.
p267_155|we came across the first set of bodies.
p267_156|seven people were later detained by police.
p267_157|i would probably have to agree with him.
p267_158|we were given a warm and friendly reception.

p267_167|the people are the hero.
p267_168|i always felt they played for me.
p267_169|it is premature to speculate on the impact.
p267_170|they made such decisions in london.
p267_171|it is a body blow.
p267_172|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p267_173|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p267_174|it is not a threat.

p267_246|it is a court case.
p267_247|he has been a success this year.
p267_248|it might be sad but it's a fact.
p267_249|he declined to give any details.
p267_250|it seems a waste of talents.
p267_251|clearly the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p267_252|if so it is a funny time to introduce it.
p267_253|his is a global perspective.
p267_254|it is a policy which has the full support of the minister.

p267_335|but the new year was special.
p267_336|they are now out in the cold.

p268_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p268_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.

p268_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.

p268_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p268_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

p268_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p268_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p268_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p268_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p268_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p268_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p268_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p268_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p268_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p268_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p268_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.

p269_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p269_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p269_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p269_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p269_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p269_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p269_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p269_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p269_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p269_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p269_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p269_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p269_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p269_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p269_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p269_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p269_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p269_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of the number of bows.
p269_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p269_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p269_025|she is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p269_026|but it failed.
p269_027|he said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p269_028|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p269_029|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p269_030|i have a theory.
p269_031|is this accurate?
p269_032|because we do not need it.
p269_033|he took me on a tour of the wards.
p269_034|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p269_035|help is needed.
p269_036|a web site is planned for november.
p269_037|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p269_038|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p269_039|that's no bad thing.
p269_040|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.

p269_045|mexico city was a wonderful experience.

p269_049|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p269_050|i was inspired by two things.
p269_051|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.

p269_063|it's that kind of place.
p269_064|they are real.
p269_065|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p269_066|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p269_067|we have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p269_068|you need a trademark.
p269_069|painful but only because it's true.
p269_070|i was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p269_071|it's a winner.
p269_072|there could be a way back.
p269_073|i was as strong as a horse.
p269_074|both sides have been hit by injury.
p269_075|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p269_076|it is a job creation scheme.
p269_077|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p269_078|he is now resident in england.
p269_079|even the one she loved.
p269_080|people must remain vigilant.
p269_081|this is the way things should be handled.
p269_082|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p269_083|i'd like to continue that record.
p269_084|that is bound to happen.
p269_085|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p269_086|all options are open.
p269_087|someone who cares
p269_088|by then he was walking on water.
p269_089|you will be.
p269_090|he put some colour into scottish history.
p269_091|we see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p269_092|the name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
p269_093|today i couldn't run on it.
p269_094|they've got to account for it.
p269_096|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p269_097|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p269_098|an announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p269_099|however the intensive care unit at the southern general hospital was full.

p269_101|we want to get to the final anyway.
p269_102|oil embargo endorsed.
p269_103|but they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p269_104|no date has been set for the appeal.
p269_105|it's not perfect.
p269_106|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p269_107|he pleaded for caution.
p269_108|it was quite rigorous.
p269_109|i was fighting for my life i thought.
p269_110|i can't even get into the a team.
p269_111|the picture is the same across scotland.
p269_112|it was the eighties.
p269_113|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p269_114|it's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p269_115|maybe this battle has been.
p269_116|my office is bare.
p269_117|every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p269_118|this is the first big idea of the scottish parliament election.
p269_119|it was a delight on every level.
p269_121|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p269_122|she has been shot.
p269_123|i thought it was a fantastic game.
p269_124|lady thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p269_125|i could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p269_126|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p269_127|next season for every manager is a long time away.
p269_128|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p269_129|it's terrible that he has died the same way.
p269_130|so the european elections are extremely important.
p269_131|offered the gold medal he declined.
p269_132|who will attend?
p269_133|twaddle is a case in point.
p269_134|we had a reunion last week.
p269_135|the trial is funded solely by edinburgh city council.
p269_136|the whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p269_137|it's the big omission.
p269_138|if not a deal could take many months.
p269_139|what will happen then?
p269_140|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p269_141|we are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p269_142|it's a question of fashion.
p269_143|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.

p269_147|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p269_148|he is severe.
p269_149|we just had a go.
p269_150|she died at her home.
p269_151|we have seen a copy of the report.
p269_152|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p269_153|that could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p269_154|it's like a football team.
p269_155|it would be a last resort.
p269_156|that group reported just before christmas.
p269_157|he will emerge as a world leader.
p269_158|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p269_159|i was so nervous.
p269_160|we want to see the maximum of change.
p269_161|last night he was due to hold talks with arafat.
p269_162|his death was a tragic accident.
p269_163|this latter point is hugely important.
p269_164|it is so unfair.
p269_165|it is an attitude of mind.
p269_166|i've put my own money into this project.
p269_167|they are expected to appear at edinburgh sheriff court today.
p269_168|i am now unemployed.
p269_169|military action is the only option we have on the table today.

p269_176|they thought they had found a home.
p269_177|his team management was protective.
p269_179|but the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p269_180|it was a great achievement to win at wembley.
p269_181|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p269_182|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p269_183|everyone can be bought.
p269_184|the conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p269_185|they know no other way.
p269_186|it's an idea.
p269_187|they will run a mile.
p269_188|four policemen were wounded.
p269_189|we did everything by the book.
p269_190|does this matter?
p269_191|my main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p269_193|it had been in place since last july.
p269_194|i think the commission has been very very slow to react.
p269_195|neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p269_196|we must keep our feet on the ground.
p269_197|mr kennedy is not a candidate for the scottish parliament.
p269_198|the bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p269_199|the conference is the first test.
p269_200|we played them off the pitch.

p269_205|it's all about money money money.
p269_206|some realism was needed about time resources and management.
p269_207|i had been at the evening standard for two years.
p269_208|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p269_209|but i am a worried man.
p269_210|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p269_211|saddam hussein is a devil.
p269_212|feel the heat?
p269_213|harry potter has lost his magic.
p269_214|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.

p269_225|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p269_226|it's so special.
p269_227|the loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p269_228|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p269_229|i have spoken to the skipper.
p269_230|i'd never seen a play about me.
p269_231|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p269_232|my neighbours are horrified.
p269_233|but she was.
p269_234|it's like a basketball.
p269_235|and thought we would get away with it.
p269_236|of course that is not the whole story.
p269_237|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p269_238|well they were the unlucky ones.

p269_241|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p269_242|a succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p269_243|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p269_244|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p269_245|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p269_246|i know i'm in a very special position.
p269_247|you can feel at home in china.
p269_248|some families have even requested to leave the city.
p269_249|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p269_250|it's a record label not a form of music.
p269_251|i was shocked.
p269_252|i should think so too.
p269_253|we decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p269_254|her presence was almost everywhere.
p269_255|i can't get a job.
p269_256|it is nearly there.
p269_257|special measures were needed.

p269_271|the government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.

p269_274|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p269_275|we do not want any terrorist attacks on any israeli civilians.
p269_276|but in fact the reverse is true.

p269_281|he promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p269_282|however he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p269_283|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p269_284|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p269_285|it happens from time to time.
p269_286|if not he should go home.
p269_287|they were too hard.
p269_288|i saw it at a ruck.
p269_289|i intended to look for another club on loan.
p269_290|you've got to have both sides.
p269_291|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p269_292|it was a virus.

p269_294|it's like a high school play.
p269_295|this is a national crisis.
p269_296|i feel really sorry for the iraqi people.
p269_297|the amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p269_298|police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p269_299|it shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p269_300|it changed my life.
p269_301|it's an issue that will have to be tackled.

p269_307|i was the sheep.
p269_308|graeme was prepared.

p269_315|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p269_316|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p269_317|it's just not funny
p269_318|it is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p269_319|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p269_320|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p269_321|scotland has shown the way.
p269_322|i did not name it.
p269_323|the government in westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p269_324|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p269_325|this wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p269_326|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p269_327|i was rubbish.
p269_328|we are a peaceful people.
p269_329|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p269_330|kids are terrible.
p269_331|henman has been warned.
p269_332|ms anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p269_333|the problems began a long time ago.
p269_334|referees are easy targets.
p269_335|they had a confession.
p269_336|in the old days it was easy.
p269_337|however the groups denied the claims.
p269_338|i came into this world with nothing.
p269_339|that's the law of the land.
p269_340|there was no time scale.
p269_341|it is a strong case.
p269_342|is there a new way forward?
p269_343|they also recovered a picture of osama bin laden.
p269_344|the boat was fantastic.
p269_345|i'd like to take the plunge.
p269_346|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p269_347|you can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p269_348|it's been hard.
p269_349|her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p269_350|it is a sign of hope.
p269_352|it has moved on in the last week.
p269_353|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p269_354|you feel the pride.
p269_355|the train was on time.
p269_356|it was so new so exciting.
p269_357|sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p269_358|a great deal has been achieved.
p269_359|it was forced to divert.
p269_360|it should be scrapped.
p269_361|it is long gone.
p269_362|i have a dream.
p269_363|tyson is overwhelmed.
p269_364|as indeed they would be.
p269_365|but the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p269_366|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p269_367|instead he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p269_368|we will be homeless.
p269_369|i expected these kind of questions.
p269_370|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p269_371|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p269_372|it's a true story.
p269_373|all the investment is possible through the public sector.
p269_374|he later became a respected high court judge.
p269_375|the play is based on a real life event.
p269_376|he could face a jail sentence.
p269_377|the final decision was between scotland and the republic of ireland.
p269_378|they have not done so this season so far.
p269_379|i decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p269_380|they play together perfectly.
p269_381|it is a large number.
p269_382|he could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p269_383|they haven't got a hope.
p269_384|it is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p269_385|he denied the charge.
p269_386|you can cope with it.
p269_387|i am very happy with life.
p269_388|a young briton had a lucky escape.
p269_389|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p269_391|if you look at the other galleries in this area.
p269_392|in scotland we keep the faith.
p269_393|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p269_394|i'm pleased about one thing.
p269_395|it is unusual.
p269_396|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p269_397|i suspect the latter.
p269_398|apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p269_399|well it did last time he was reminded.
p269_400|by then a massive legal battle is likely to have started.

p270_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p270_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p270_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p270_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p270_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.

p270_424|this is a huge boost for my confidence.
p270_425|it was a breathtaking moment.
p270_426|it needs to be volatile.
p270_427|the need for any new un resolutions will be put on hold.
p270_428|the woman is basically off her head.
p270_429|i never won a penny throughout my career.
p270_430|thomson is expected to manage the business.
p270_431|the reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p270_432|in fact the reasons are simple.
p270_433|we know about the crisis in cattle.
p270_434|the british government does not want to know.
p270_435|it is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p270_436|i didn't get to keep it.
p270_437|their condition is described as satisfactory.
p270_438|it would be very dangerous.
p270_439|senior management in scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p270_440|the villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p270_441|it is not over by any means.
p270_442|it deserved to be a winner.
p270_443|they are interior designers and architects.
p270_444|it shows the right amount of progress.
p270_445|i think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p270_446|they had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p270_447|it was to be inclusive.
p270_448|no further details of expansion plans were given.
p270_449|the budget was too low for that.
p270_450|our legal advice is clear.
p270_451|striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p270_452|a fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p270_453|they were good years for him.
p270_454|let that be their memorial.
p270_455|this is the stuff of live music.
p270_456|we expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
p270_457|we will deal with the refugees.
p270_458|if that's the case he will struggle.
p270_459|we are over the moon.
p270_460|they're just a good retailer.
p270_461|we are now up against it.
p270_462|something happened on that island.
p271_001|please call stella.
p271_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p271_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p271_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p271_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p271_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p271_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p271_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p271_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p271_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p271_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p271_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p271_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p271_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p271_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p271_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p271_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p271_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p271_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p271_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p271_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p271_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p271_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p271_025|she looked so young.
p271_026|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p271_027|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p271_028|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p271_029|they have no history.
p271_030|however the following year the cancer returned.
p271_031|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p271_032|i'd just like to play.
p271_033|this is the window.
p271_034|i feel i did not have enough time.
p271_035|we speak about the performance.
p271_036|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p271_037|it was clear.
p271_038|indeed he does.
p271_039|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p271_040|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p271_041|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p271_042|we will push.
p271_043|i hate the word.
p271_044|they said she was stable.
p271_045|among them are many criminals.
p271_046|is a drug dealer?
p271_047|there is no reason at all.
p271_048|he is too weak to move.
p271_049|they were on holiday in egypt.
p271_050|every aspect of our play was first class.
p271_051|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p271_052|here's a clue.
p271_053|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p271_054|i guess i was lucky though.
p271_055|i was inspired by two things.
p271_056|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p271_057|i love the dome.
p271_058|it's so awful.
p271_059|it is unique.
p271_060|i expect a rapid response.
p271_061|that's the truth.
p271_062|jobs could go.
p271_063|we need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p271_064|scotland had great assets.
p271_065|it's that kind of place.
p271_066|they are real.
p271_067|it's good news and long overdue.
p271_068|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p271_069|we should have known.
p271_070|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p271_071|try to save us.
p271_072|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p271_073|he was at home with his pals.
p271_074|it's all i can do.
p271_075|there could be a way back.
p271_076|then followed a bout of flu.
p271_077|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p271_078|neither it is.
p271_079|is there a new way forward?
p271_080|the party is up for it.
p271_081|even the one she loved.
p271_082|he is in the queue.
p271_083|he is driven.
p271_084|a play is a set of actions.
p271_085|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p271_086|someone who cares
p271_087|by then he was walking on water.
p271_088|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p271_089|they lived for their children.
p271_090|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p271_091|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p271_092|it is a lifeline.
p271_093|maloney is an engaging talent.
p271_094|he was possessed
p271_095|i have every confidence in raymond robertson as chairman of the party.
p271_096|this one did.
p271_097|then came the crunch.
p271_098|it is annoying.
p271_099|it is home grown.
p271_100|they are now divorced.
p271_101|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p271_102|i saw the whole thing.
p271_103|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p271_104|i'm not looking for a breakthrough.
p271_105|it is a love affair.
p271_106|they make a selective perception process.
p271_107|that would be unlawful.
p271_108|we have an election in eight days.
p271_109|he takes the job.
p271_110|she reflects a bit.
p271_111|the cause of the fire is not yet known.
p271_112|health secretary frank dobson made the surprise announcement in the commons yesterday.
p271_114|i am an actor.
p271_115|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p271_116|it was the eighties.
p271_117|i did not see any reason to change the captain.
p271_118|it is so sad.
p271_119|you had better believe it.
p271_120|it's not fair.
p271_121|mr chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p271_122|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p271_123|who would have?
p271_124|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p271_125|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.
p271_126|the people will come.

p271_128|the task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p271_129|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p271_130|we work well together.
p271_131|what will happen then?
p271_132|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p271_133|police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p271_134|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p271_135|it was very frightened and dirty.
p271_136|is that it?
p271_137|my daughter is an adult.
p271_138|he should resign.
p271_139|i was dead.
p271_140|if people are genuine then the problem is not osama bin laden.
p271_141|it seems so long since i did the exams.
p271_142|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p271_143|and the farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p271_144|she died at her home.
p271_145|he realises his mistake.
p271_146|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p271_147|i was awful.
p271_148|he sets the nature of his parliament in a simple realistic context.
p271_149|note the date.
p271_150|so i got a blood test.
p271_151|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p271_152|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p271_153|the amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p271_154|the weather forecast isn't good.
p271_155|crucially though united were still alive.
p271_156|work has started.
p271_157|my dad is a hero.
p271_158|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p271_159|words were not required.
p271_160|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p271_161|that includes the equipment?
p271_162|these days are long gone.
p271_163|i'd love to be like peter.
p271_164|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p271_165|it has to be now.
p271_166|i haven't had a lesson in four years.
p271_167|as indeed they would be.
p271_168|local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p271_169|they are not advertised.
p271_170|the consultants report commissioned by the previous government was not published.
p271_171|tell it like it was?
p271_172|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p271_173|we have a budget in march.
p271_174|by then however both men were already in the us.
p271_175|you had to go and see him.
p271_176|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p271_177|it is really good news.
p271_178|he was a crazy man.
p271_179|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p271_180|one season they might do well.
p271_181|as we worked.
p271_182|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p271_183|the event was held in the council's headquarters in hamilton.
p271_184|if that's the case he will struggle.
p271_185|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p271_186|the conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p271_187|the goals were good.
p271_188|i've been there.
p271_189|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p271_190|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p271_191|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p271_192|what has caused the demise of singing?
p271_193|one was a lawyer.
p271_194|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p271_195|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p271_196|however he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p271_197|treasury spokesman malcolm bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p271_198|i think the commission has been very very slow to react.
p271_199|it is a farce.
p271_200|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p271_201|i came home by ambulance.
p271_202|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p271_203|it opened last month.
p271_204|we believe a third party was involved.
p271_205|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p271_206|tommy is not a problem.
p271_207|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p271_208|he had suffered a heart attack.
p271_209|it was worth a photograph.
p271_210|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p271_211|i don't want to use it.
p271_212|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p271_213|you have a plan?
p271_214|it had all been arranged.
p271_215|i had decided to quit the show.
p271_216|i have wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p271_217|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p271_218|i might come back.
p271_219|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p271_220|that idea is rubbish.
p271_221|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p271_222|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p271_223|we could easily be cut again.
p271_224|he seemed to lose his focus.
p271_225|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p271_226|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p271_227|clearly the stakes are high.
p271_228|i will win.
p271_229|i am immensely sad.
p271_230|it's not before time.
p271_231|he said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p271_232|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p271_233|at the time he was a living legend.
p271_234|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p271_235|the move was also welcomed by the national union of journalists.
p271_236|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p271_237|we were awful.
p271_238|they tried to give her advice.
p271_239|we are so proud.
p271_240|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p271_241|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p271_242|it's quite nice.
p271_243|three weeks later he resigned.
p271_244|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p271_245|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p271_246|of further privacy he had no need.
p271_247|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p271_248|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p271_249|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p271_250|it is hard won.
p271_251|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p271_252|you can feel at home in china.
p271_253|the scene is about this?
p271_254|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p271_255|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p271_256|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p271_257|the concerns are the same.
p271_258|that could be in place by next year.
p271_259|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p271_260|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p271_261|chelsea was a great club.
p271_262|is that a serious question?
p271_263|this is the first step.
p271_264|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p271_265|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p271_266|blood samples were taken.
p271_267|we shall rely on human beings.
p271_268|this is a question of islam.
p271_269|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p271_270|you take a risk.
p271_271|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p271_272|he was also married with two children.
p271_273|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p271_274|the prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p271_275|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p271_276|that goes back a long way.
p271_277|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p271_278|she failed in her action.
p271_279|they seem to get away with it.
p271_280|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p271_281|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p271_282|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p271_283|we are a grandmother.
p271_284|he looked very sharp.
p271_285|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p271_286|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p271_287|you feel very helpless.
p271_288|you've got to have both sides.
p271_289|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p271_290|it was a virus.
p271_291|she is an expert on medical ethics.
p271_292|it's a record label not a form of music.
p271_293|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p271_294|this is a national crisis.
p271_295|we are not going to forget.
p271_296|no briton has ever won.
p271_297|he added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p271_298|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p271_299|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p271_300|nothing is safe.
p271_301|the award to senator mitchell was announced by the foreign office.
p271_302|there is no openness.
p271_303|they are wrong.
p271_304|eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p271_305|this is a war over our home.
p271_306|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p271_307|the court had a number of empty seats.
p271_308|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p271_309|the plot is minimal.
p271_310|it wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p271_311|there is no excuse.
p271_312|the letters are going out today.
p271_313|the government in westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p271_314|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p271_315|the premier league has been a huge success.
p271_316|my whole life has changed.
p271_317|we are a peaceful people.
p271_318|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p271_319|henman has been warned.
p271_320|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p271_321|for the moment our position remains the same.
p271_322|they had a confession.
p271_323|we are in the end game.
p271_324|it will work.
p271_325|it's too horrible to think.
p271_326|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p271_327|there was no time scale.
p271_328|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p271_329|it is a job creation scheme.
p271_330|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p271_331|relief was beyond belief.
p271_332|is that an issue?
p271_333|they should take their mobile phones.
p271_334|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p271_335|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p271_336|the commitment was not long and it was worth the risk.
p271_337|who will do it?
p271_338|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p271_339|locally too the mp is under fire.
p271_340|i've got no secret.
p271_341|this is a big advantage.
p271_342|went on sale.
p271_343|yet for my money he was not the man of the match.
p271_344|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p271_345|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p271_346|a few days after making the video i went to the inquiry.
p271_347|i got a yellow card.
p271_348|we have big ideas.
p271_349|i believe the gap is nearly there.
p271_350|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p271_351|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p271_352|until they came to do it.
p271_353|it is not like us.
p271_354|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p271_355|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p271_356|we will be homeless.
p271_357|that would help.
p271_358|my husband was angry.
p271_359|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p271_360|it is a memorial.
p271_361|and he laughs.
p271_362|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p271_363|there was a substantial explosion.
p271_364|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p271_365|their time has gone.
p271_366|it has only been rumours.
p271_367|all the investment is possible through the public sector.
p271_368|the death rates are still as high.
p271_369|now though he has an incentive.
p271_370|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p271_371|it seems a long time ago.
p271_372|there is no signature.
p271_373|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p271_374|it became a national network.
p271_375|i am a wealthy person.
p271_376|the bbc was a disgrace.
p271_377|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p271_378|of course we will need to strengthen the squad for europe.
p271_379|it has been a lovely family occasion.
p271_380|that's the name of the game though.
p271_381|since then he has played no active part in the company.
p271_382|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p271_383|yet the data is compelling.
p271_384|it's a real problem.
p271_385|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p271_386|who will provide the wine?
p271_387|it is unusual.
p271_388|they deserved the win.
p271_389|public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p271_390|well it did last time he was reminded.
p271_391|i love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p271_392|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p271_393|he repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p271_394|but we are a young side.
p271_395|by then a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p271_396|it will take place in july.
p271_397|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p271_398|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p271_399|but in fact the reverse is true.
p271_400|it is full scale.
p271_401|i never won a penny throughout my career.
p271_402|he will be judged by his actions.
p271_403|it is an absolute nonsense.
p271_404|they are not left wing.
p271_405|they recorded their debut album in new york.
p271_406|in a way he was.
p271_407|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p271_408|it might be.
p271_409|the weekly average was three hours.
p271_410|he scored a touchdown.
p271_411|quality meat scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p271_412|he got his degree.
p271_413|the package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p271_414|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p271_415|but we finished the show.
p271_416|senior management in scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p271_417|the shareholders will vote to wind up the company on friday morning.
p271_418|that may be.
p271_419|it is legally binding.
p271_420|is there any prospect of this happening?
p271_421|the service from the other players was super.
p271_422|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p271_423|paris is not only young.
p271_424|that deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p271_425|he is to appeal.
p271_426|it was like someone had died.
p271_427|i'm very grateful.
p271_428|the weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p271_429|we have the location which is assured.
p271_430|there is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p271_431|nine days later he suffered another attack.
p271_432|i know the worry over iraq.
p271_433|everything has collapsed.
p271_434|scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p271_435|it is not either national standards or local control.
p271_436|the document argues that culture is at the heart of scottish society.
p271_437|we are all equal.
p271_438|admission is free.
p271_439|we are now up against it.
p271_440|in it went.
p271_441|we were used.
p271_442|last year it was won by jack mcconnell the first minister.
p271_443|there is no evidence of a little scotland emerging.
p271_444|however he held out little hope that the government would take action.
p271_445|they were not even allowed to see them.
p271_446|that brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p271_447|bill is a mentor.
p271_448|we are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
p271_449|it will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p271_450|was it worth it?
p271_451|it was ignored.
p271_452|it is bizarre.
p271_453|it had been in place since last july.
p271_454|it's a miracle.
p272_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p272_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p272_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p272_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p272_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p272_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p272_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p272_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p272_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p272_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p272_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p272_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p272_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p272_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p272_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p272_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p272_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p272_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p272_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p272_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p272_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p272_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p272_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p272_025|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p272_026|is this accurate?
p272_027|they have no history.
p272_028|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p272_029|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p272_030|there's a story too.
p272_031|this is the window.
p272_032|he was jailed for five years.
p272_033|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p272_034|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p272_035|then suddenly they weren't.
p272_036|was it worth it?
p272_037|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p272_038|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p272_039|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p272_040|they're just different.
p272_041|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p272_042|a quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p272_043|indeed he does.
p272_044|i did not see any reason to change the captain.
p272_045|he's just in it for himself.
p272_046|however the decision has been welcomed by scottish enterprise officials.
p272_047|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p272_048|we will push.
p272_049|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p272_050|this represents a tough game for us.
p272_051|it is bizarre.
p272_052|they said she was stable.
p272_053|is a drug dealer?
p272_054|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p272_055|he is too weak to move.
p272_056|they were on holiday in egypt.
p272_057|he looks like an afghan.
p272_058|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p272_059|here's a clue.
p272_060|it had been in place since last july.
p272_061|next league matches celtic.
p272_062|there was no safety net.
p272_063|it is unique.
p272_064|that's the truth.
p272_065|they are ready.
p272_066|we need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p272_067|i feel i did not have enough time.
p272_068|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p272_069|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p272_070|they are real.
p272_071|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p272_072|that was a gold medal for certain.
p272_073|he was popular.
p272_074|but i've won both ways.
p272_075|there was an e mail.
p272_076|sounds like the sixth sense?
p272_077|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p272_078|painful but only because it's true.
p272_079|i had my suspicions.
p272_080|he was at home with his pals.
p272_081|it was magic.
p272_082|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p272_083|it is a job creation scheme.
p272_084|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p272_085|even the one she loved.
p272_086|today she has been released.
p272_087|he is in the queue.
p272_088|he liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p272_089|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p272_090|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p272_091|someone who cares
p272_092|by then he was walking on water.
p272_093|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p272_094|it is a blow.
p272_095|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p272_096|they lived for their children.
p272_097|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p272_098|today i couldn't run on it.
p272_099|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p272_100|i was a spectator that is as far as it goes.
p272_101|it was clear.
p272_102|it is annoying.
p272_103|but i was wrong.
p272_104|i love the dome.
p272_105|we have always maintained that we would never abandon scottish football.
p272_106|our position remains unchanged.
p272_107|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p272_108|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p272_109|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p272_110|you should be.
p272_111|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p272_112|two of the team became ill.
p272_113|he takes the job.
p272_114|she reflects a bit.
p272_115|i am just trying to do my job.
p272_116|health secretary frank dobson made the surprise announcement in the commons yesterday.
p272_117|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p272_118|i was fighting for my life i thought.
p272_119|naturally it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p272_120|it is so sad.
p272_121|the mood is upbeat.
p272_122|it is rubbish.
p272_123|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p272_124|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p272_125|who would have?
p272_126|there were no grounds for his action.
p272_127|i can't even get into the a team.
p272_128|i'm so angry.
p272_129|she really suffered for her art.
p272_130|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p272_131|the task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p272_132|no production was achieved.
p272_133|the bbc was a disgrace.
p272_134|this tour is critical for new zealand rugby.
p272_135|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p272_136|the judges will give a ruling next wednesday.
p272_137|police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p272_138|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p272_139|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p272_140|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p272_141|i had decided to quit the show.
p272_142|we want to keep the pound.
p272_143|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p272_144|and the farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p272_145|who would be right?
p272_146|she died at her home.
p272_147|he realises his mistake.
p272_148|the role of the law lords would be retained.
p272_149|it is not just about pay.
p272_150|labour's scottish general secretary alex rowley was delighted yesterday.
p272_151|so i got a blood test.
p272_152|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p272_153|but he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p272_154|i was so nervous.
p272_155|crucially though united were still alive.
p272_156|the departure of mr johnston was reported by the herald yesterday.
p272_157|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p272_158|we are on a four year mission.
p272_159|they should come clean.
p272_160|my dad is a hero.
p272_161|he can do no wrong.
p272_162|well he should know.
p272_163|it is so unfair.
p272_164|i will tell you.
p272_165|i've put my own money into this project.
p272_166|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p272_167|it is not like us.
p272_168|we've all had the shots.
p272_169|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p272_170|again we were lucky.
p272_171|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p272_172|does that put pressure on us?
p272_173|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p272_174|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p272_175|as we worked.
p272_176|tony had arrived.
p272_177|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p272_178|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p272_179|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p272_180|they need to look after themselves.
p272_181|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p272_182|what has caused the demise of singing?
p272_183|our team is just so young.
p272_184|any change would be subject to the scottish parliament's approval.
p272_185|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p272_186|treasury spokesman malcolm bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p272_187|but a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p272_188|peace was won.
p272_189|it's a fact.
p272_190|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p272_191|we believe a third party was involved.
p272_192|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p272_193|tommy is not a problem.
p272_194|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p272_195|but she might be.
p272_196|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p272_197|it was worth a photograph.
p272_198|they make a selective perception process.
p272_199|we have an election in eight days.
p272_200|even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p272_201|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p272_202|the proposals are to be debated on monday by city councillors.
p272_203|twaddle is a case in point.
p272_204|a grampian police spokesman said.
p272_205|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p272_206|in each case they were a goal down.
p272_207|i have wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p272_208|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p272_209|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p272_210|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p272_211|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p272_212|i am very sorry that alastair campbell has taken this decision.
p272_213|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p272_214|you should always be able to get out in some direction.
p272_215|it's not before time.
p272_216|the report is due out next month.
p272_217|but she was.
p272_218|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p272_219|at the time he was a living legend.
p272_220|they must do it.
p272_221|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p272_222|however no further action was taken by police.
p272_223|until they came to do it.
p272_224|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p272_225|well they were the unlucky ones.
p272_226|there is no excuse.
p272_227|three weeks later he resigned.
p272_228|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p272_229|but it's a subtle process.
p272_230|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p272_231|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p272_232|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p272_233|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p272_234|it is hard won.
p272_235|our policy is clear.
p272_236|the scene is about this?
p272_237|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p272_238|there wasn't a goal.
p272_239|i should think so too.
p272_240|there's the mix.
p272_241|the concerns are the same.
p272_242|i can't get a job.
p272_243|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p272_244|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p272_245|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p272_246|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p272_247|so in a sense it was a government subsidy.
p272_248|is that a serious question?
p272_249|this is the first step.
p272_250|they must play for each other.
p272_251|souter will be back.
p272_252|george w bush the us president condemned the attacks.
p272_253|blood samples were taken.
p272_254|they want to shut the scottish office.
p272_255|we shall rely on human beings.
p272_256|this is a question of islam.
p272_257|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p272_258|immediate action must be taken.
p272_259|it's very nice.
p272_260|he was also married with two children.
p272_261|the system can work.
p272_262|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p272_263|we're in shock.
p272_264|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p272_265|it's a way of life.
p272_266|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p272_267|it was very fast.
p272_268|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p272_269|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p272_270|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p272_271|if not he should go home.
p272_272|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p272_273|he looked very sharp.
p272_274|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p272_275|all options are open.
p272_276|dialogue is the key.
p272_277|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p272_278|it was a virus.
p272_279|maloney is an engaging talent.
p272_280|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p272_281|this is a national crisis.
p272_282|it was good.
p272_283|who did the recruiting?
p272_284|bombing slaughter rejected
p272_285|the songs are just so good.
p272_286|the goals will come.
p272_287|there's a pause.
p272_288|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p272_289|i was the sheep.
p272_290|what has altered?
p272_291|i was brought up in a mining background.
p272_292|nothing is safe.
p272_293|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p272_294|one was a lawyer.
p272_295|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p272_296|they are wrong.
p272_297|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p272_298|the plot is minimal.
p272_299|you are the glory.
p272_300|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p272_301|the letters are going out today.
p272_302|we want to play at the worlds.
p272_303|he is also keen to win the european order of merit.
p272_304|my whole life has changed.
p272_305|we are a peaceful people.
p272_306|you may have a short memory.
p272_307|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p272_308|my body is clearly capable.
p272_309|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p272_310|it is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p272_311|a review is under way.
p272_312|it will work.
p272_313|i came into this world with nothing.
p272_314|it's too horrible to think.
p272_315|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p272_316|off with their heads.
p272_317|is there a new way forward?
p272_318|i was invited to work in germany.
p272_319|is that an issue?
p272_320|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p272_321|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p272_322|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p272_323|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p272_324|it sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p272_325|well it won't.
p272_326|these days are long gone.
p272_327|two people were interviewed.
p272_328|i've got no secret.
p272_329|the package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p272_330|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p272_331|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p272_332|yet for my money he was not the man of the match.
p272_333|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p272_334|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p272_335|he loves the big occasions.
p272_336|the performance was excellent.
p272_337|that has been lost.
p272_338|tell us about it.
p272_339|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p272_340|she said they would appeal.
p272_341|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p272_342|another case of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in scotland yesterday.
p272_343|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p272_344|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p272_345|it was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p272_346|as indeed they would be.
p272_347|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p272_348|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p272_349|we will be homeless.
p272_350|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p272_351|mr anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p272_352|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p272_353|there was a substantial explosion.
p272_354|not so it seems.
p272_355|he could make it.
p272_356|four policemen were wounded.
p272_357|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p272_358|it's now down in black and white.
p272_359|now though he has an incentive.
p272_360|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p272_361|they have not done so this season so far.
p272_362|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p272_363|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p272_364|so there we won.
p272_365|by that time however it was already too late.
p272_366|there is no signature.
p272_367|it was a funny game.
p272_368|he was the architect.
p272_369|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p272_370|i've never seen a game like it.
p272_371|i am a wealthy person.
p272_372|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p272_373|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p272_374|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p272_375|something is wrong.
p272_376|you can cope with it.
p272_377|i didn't know that i had a court appearance on wednesday.
p272_378|that's the name of the game though.
p272_379|since then he has played no active part in the company.
p272_380|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p272_381|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p272_382|at the last i found a bunker.
p272_383|yet the data is compelling.
p272_384|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p272_385|it's a real problem.
p272_386|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p272_387|i was in the train station overnight.
p272_388|it is unusual.
p272_389|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p272_390|it's like a basketball.
p272_391|well it did last time he was reminded.
p272_392|i love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p272_393|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p272_394|it was a kind of contempt.
p272_395|it was a breathtaking moment.
p272_396|the car was just there.
p272_397|it will take place in july.
p272_398|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p272_399|is that possible?
p272_400|but in fact the reverse is true.
p272_401|what was the difference between them?
p272_402|emotions were complex.
p272_403|then he laughs.
p272_404|whether the high court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p272_405|it is an absolute nonsense.
p272_406|they recorded their debut album in new york.
p272_407|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p272_408|he has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p272_409|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p272_410|feel the air the space.
p272_411|he got his degree.
p272_412|i reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p273_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p273_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p273_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p273_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p273_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p273_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p273_008|these take the shape of a long round arch and its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p273_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p273_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p273_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p273_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p273_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p273_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p273_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p273_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p273_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p273_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p273_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p273_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p273_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p273_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p273_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p273_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p273_025|a shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p273_026|it was as if i had been stabbed.
p273_027|because we do not need it.
p273_028|it is about control of our economy.
p273_029|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p273_030|it is a tough game but we have a chance.
p273_031|i feel so desperately sorry for gordon and sarah.
p273_032|it carries a double message.
p273_033|that is the face of fear.
p273_034|the staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p273_035|among them are many criminals.
p273_036|this will save interest charges.
p273_037|every aspect of our play was first class.
p273_038|he looks like an afghan.
p273_039|everything else is a bonus.
p273_040|people want to see me on the screen.
p273_041|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p273_042|i was inspired by two things.
p273_043|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p273_044|my fitness was very poor.
p273_045|we have to look beyond the very short term.
p273_046|the drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
p273_047|i expect a rapid response.
p273_048|i must take a seat.
p273_049|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p273_050|how are you sir ?
p273_051|so is that it then ?
p273_052|do i have a favourite ?
p273_053|what do we do ?
p273_054|the situation is not easy but we will prevail.
p273_055|let's hope that it does.
p273_056|we have to keep our clients.
p273_057|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p273_058|we will pay their bills.
p273_059|it was exactly four months away.
p273_060|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p273_061|i was conceived in aberdeen.
p273_062|robin williams is very subdued.
p273_063|the spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p273_064|i was as strong as a horse.
p273_065|we should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p273_066|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p273_067|both sides have been hit by injury.
p273_068|the creditors have lost a lot.
p273_069|stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p273_070|even the one she loved.
p273_071|just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p273_072|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p273_073|it makes for an interesting conference.
p273_074|this view was echoed by another scottish analyst.
p273_075|no progress has been made.
p273_076|he has been a success this year.
p273_077|they have now been banned from celtic park for life.
p273_078|we have to offer value for money.
p273_079|that should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p273_080|it's so hard to shift.
p273_081|they lived for their children.
p273_082|potions said he would drive.
p273_083|last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p273_084|he had missed a penalty against the english.
p273_085|the allegations were still under investigation he added.

p273_087|he is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p273_088|it was clear on thursday.
p273_089|it was a family tragedy.

p273_091|they like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p273_092|he was prepared for this.
p273_093|gordon marshall was outstanding against us.
p273_094|we haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p273_095|we intend to change the model.
p273_096|we should recognise that others have done a good job.
p273_097|but the battle has only just begun.
p273_098|the following are the principal provisions.
p273_099|before the game we went for a pint.
p273_100|athletics is on a roll in the country.
p273_101|i'm delighted for everyone at stirling.
p273_102|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p273_103|we deserve a significant rise.
p273_104|got to win today though.
p273_105|the pressure is on them.
p273_106|new year will be very busy.
p273_107|there's still plenty of time left.
p273_108|i didn't think so either.
p273_109|he thought she was amazing.
p273_110|i came here this week to work.
p273_111|then again we could have.
p273_112|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p273_113|here again they were denied a voice.
p273_114|we would make a start.
p273_115|his job was not advertised.
p273_116|this is a frightening development.
p273_117|which can happen any time.
p273_118|that is far too high.
p273_119|my life has changed a lot.
p273_120|customers for the panels include the national trust for scotland.
p273_121|that would open the gates of hell.
p273_122|you are a gambling man.
p273_123|it feels like a privilege.
p273_124|that is the ultimate revenge.
p273_125|i am totally devoted to this job.
p273_126|we'll have to think about it.
p273_127|i love the spectacle of cinema.
p273_128|the findings are published in the british journal of cancer.

p273_136|she had gone to the catholic school.
p273_137|one letter from a teacher arrived at christmas.
p273_138|it would seem a natural progression.
p273_139|it was a terrible combination of factors.
p273_140|today is not a victory.
p273_141|why do it otherwise ?
p273_142|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p273_143|so did she meet him ?
p273_144|so what is the campaign about ?
p273_145|and does it ?
p273_146|are you from the rugby ?
p273_147|had i heard ?
p273_148|this action reflects a slump in bookings.
p273_149|they should stop the bombing.
p273_150|the internet is no substitute for customer service.
p273_151|i'm not going to answer that right now.
p273_152|it's never great to finish second.
p273_153|the long term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
p273_154|further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p273_155|they could not match it.
p273_156|i always felt they played for me.
p273_157|his team management was protective.
p273_158|one season they might do well.
p273_159|the jury is still out.
p273_160|phase one was a shambles.
p273_161|i did not have a bet on myself.
p273_162|it is also very valuable.

p273_164|they are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p273_165|says the duke of york.

p273_167|hopefully it will bring new customers.
p273_168|david sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p273_169|you know the sort of thing.
p273_170|it was a bit like having children.
p273_171|it shows the strength of the roots.
p273_172|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p273_173|this youngster is so exciting
p273_174|two years later she was dead.
p273_175|it's very difficult to find a buyer.
p273_176|neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p273_177|everyone can have their opinion.
p273_178|because he was born in england.
p273_179|i came home by ambulance.
p273_180|what happened in that game ?
p273_181|are you going to win ?
p273_182|was it the wife ?

p273_222|the output price index in december was unchanged on november.
p273_223|they would have to go to the royal.
p273_224|but he failed to win the committee's support.

p273_228|we have not been approached.

p273_242|you can feel at home in china.
p273_243|does the name matter ?
p273_244|how do you get it back ?
p273_245|what are you not good at ?
p273_246|i think therefore i am ?

p273_250|paterson can afford to be generous.
p273_251|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p273_252|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p273_253|it makes no difference to their friendship.
p273_254|no production contract is yet in sight.
p273_255|it was the climax of the thing.
p273_256|we accept the new rules.

p274_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p274_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p274_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p274_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p274_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p274_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p274_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p274_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
p274_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p274_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p274_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p274_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p274_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p274_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p274_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p274_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p274_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p274_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p274_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p274_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p274_025|i can't play the game for them.
p274_026|she is employed on short term contracts.
p274_027|drugs are a serious problem.
p274_028|this is a central issue.
p274_029|not if you know the person.
p274_030|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p274_031|mr darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p274_032|costs have got to be controlled.
p274_033|you must always attempt to raise the bar.

p274_116|which can happen any time.
p274_117|we had another last tuesday.
p274_118|this should begin in october.
p274_119|i was on a roll.
p274_120|there is no evidence that these people are helpful.

p274_166|they had been forced to walk.
p274_167|the reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p274_168|it's not good at all.

p274_248|employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p274_249|the effects are not all bad.

p274_320|are they free ?
p274_321|what are they for ?
p274_322|is there a waiting list ?
p274_323|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p274_324|so what happens next ?
p274_325|had this been common practice ?
p274_326|what do they want us to do ?
p274_327|is it worth it ?
p274_328|there was no hint of scandal.

p274_330|we're not an employment agency.
p274_331|she had gone to the catholic school.
p274_332|but i have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.
p274_333|the group is not paying a dividend.
p274_334|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p274_335|he has left the company.
p274_336|and he goes with it.
p274_337|there will be good prospects ahead.
p274_338|it is a court case.
p274_339|there is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p274_340|this is a historic occasion.
p274_341|writing has diminished in value.
p274_342|that's the way it goes.
p274_343|after some discussion they did.
p274_344|no one wants a dispute.
p274_345|our season is not finished.
p274_346|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p274_347|the business model is actually very exciting.
p274_348|there was some merit in that.
p274_349|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p274_350|other people had looked at it.
p274_351|he declined to comment on possible disposals.
p274_352|it was tough to contain the excitement.
p274_353|either team will be hard.
p274_354|the pain is still acute.
p274_355|shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p274_356|it's wonderful to have won.
p274_357|this might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p274_358|governments will have to respond.
p274_359|we have very limited capacity.
p274_360|it is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.

p274_368|but the foreign secretary can cope.
p274_369|i got a yellow card.
p274_370|does it matter ?
p274_371|how do you take them away ?
p274_372|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p274_373|after the match do you ?
p274_374|it had been a magical moment.
p274_375|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p274_376|yesterday was a statement of intent.
p274_377|those people must be accountable.
p274_378|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p274_379|scrutiny by the european parliament is limited.
p274_380|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p274_381|this hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p274_382|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p274_383|it was like a weekly wage.
p274_384|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p274_385|it will be completed within a year.
p274_386|the pair are very much in love.
p274_387|everything is now in place for manchester.

p274_393|the law would appear to be on our side.
p274_394|the board meetings will be held in edinburgh.
p274_396|there was a substantial explosion.
p274_397|it's never great to finish second.
p274_398|finally he paid for the movie.
p274_399|the government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p274_400|it has only been rumours.
p274_401|he put some colour into scottish history.
p274_402|clark is back on top form.
p274_403|we're not taking any risks.
p274_404|neither man has been charged.
p274_405|the members have voted against it.
p274_406|it's too close to call.
p274_407|nobody will be forced to work.
p274_408|i was happy to be recognised by mike tyson.
p274_409|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p274_410|i've had a wonderful career.
p274_411|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p274_412|thankfully peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p274_413|but the foundations have been laid.
p274_414|that is the ultimate revenge.
p274_415|it's just a training thing.
p274_416|a ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p274_417|they've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p274_418|george is on a two day visit to scotland.
p274_419|the second goal was superb.
p274_420|hopefully the answer is in the positive.
p274_421|i was pleased with my own game.
p274_422|this market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p274_423|this should put downward pressure on inflation.
p274_424|not that scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p274_425|the projections are very positive for south africa.
p274_426|being captain of this club is fantastic.
p274_427|such an attack is bizarre.
p274_428|it needs to be volatile.
p274_429|i never had a childhood.
p274_430|the need for any new un resolutions will be put on hold.
p274_431|a police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p274_432|the trial will open today.
p274_433|there is another important factor.
p274_434|this is a limited market.
p274_435|its failure is no surprise.
p274_436|no doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p274_437|the festival is prepared to help.
p274_438|strangely enough i felt very sharp.
p274_439|his message was very simple.
p274_440|the boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p274_441|i didn't get to keep it.
p274_442|their condition is described as satisfactory.
p274_443|last week against nelson we allowed them several opportunities.
p274_444|they are interior designers and architects.
p274_445|senior management in scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p274_446|it wouldn't matter if he had.
p274_447|no further details of expansion plans were given.
p274_448|the villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p274_449|it is pretty bad news.
p274_450|we just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p274_451|it could cause a little bit of disruption.
p274_452|but we have built a platform for next season.
p274_453|i think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p274_454|we think a lot of allan mcgregor.
p274_455|it was like someone had died.
p274_456|they offer a kind of narrative.
p274_457|we're still the only ones in the high street.
p274_458|a fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p274_459|now that business is banned.
p274_460|let that be their memorial.
p274_461|the boys are mentally focused.
p274_462|driving has been the key.
p274_463|it's because they can't understand the language.
p274_464|then came the farewell to europe.
p274_465|the edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p274_466|phil mickelson did that last year.
p274_467|the answer was up there on the stage.
p274_468|it recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
p274_469|he will not be involved in school discipline.
p274_470|you have to have a proven track record to get them.
p275_001|please call stella.
p275_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p275_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p275_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p275_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p275_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p275_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p275_009|there is according to the legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p275_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p275_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p275_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
p275_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p275_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p275_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p275_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p275_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p275_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p275_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p275_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p275_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p275_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p275_025|but it failed.
p275_026|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p275_027|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p275_028|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p275_029|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p275_030|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p275_031|there's a story too.
p275_032|he was jailed for four years.
p275_033|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p275_034|then suddenly they weren't.
p275_035|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p275_036|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p275_037|they're just different.
p275_038|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p275_039|indeed he does.
p275_040|sadly it can't.
p275_041|dancing was her life.
p275_042|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p275_043|we will push.
p275_044|the shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p275_045|this represents a tough game for us.
p275_046|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p275_047|among them are many criminals.
p275_048|every aspect of our play was first class.
p275_049|he looks like an afghan.
p275_050|here's a clue.
p275_051|i had come back from london.
p275_052|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p275_053|it is unique.
p275_054|that's the truth.
p275_055|there's a danger.
p275_056|we need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p275_057|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p275_058|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p275_059|this is the first step.
p275_060|it's good news and long overdue.
p275_061|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p275_062|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p275_063|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p275_064|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p275_065|try to save us.
p275_066|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p275_067|sounds like the sixth sense?
p275_068|strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
p275_069|he was at home with his pals.
p275_070|it's all i can do.
p275_071|there could be a way back.
p275_072|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p275_073|it works for us.
p275_074|the party is up for it.
p275_075|the final decision was between scotland and the republic of ireland.
p275_076|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p275_077|i will miss him.
p275_078|a review is under way.
p275_079|he had suffered a heart attack.
p275_080|he is driven.
p275_081|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p275_082|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p275_083|they lived for their children.
p275_084|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p275_085|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p275_086|it is a lifeline.
p275_087|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p275_088|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p275_089|i have every confidence in raymond robertson as chairman of the party.
p275_090|but i was wrong.
p275_091|i saw the whole thing.
p275_092|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p275_093|hartley should know.
p275_094|it is a love affair.
p275_095|may not have been at fault?
p275_096|meanwhile the scottish consumer council yesterday offered support for the new bill.
p275_097|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p275_098|there will be no repeat of that performance that i can guarantee.
p275_099|oil embargo endorsed.
p275_100|there were no grounds for his action.
p275_101|he takes the job.
p275_102|she reflects a bit.
p275_103|now though he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
p275_104|health secretary frank dobson made the surprise announcement in the commons yesterday.
p275_105|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p275_106|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p275_108|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p275_109|it's a shame.
p275_110|it was the eighties.
p275_111|it is a financial matter.
p275_112|it is so sad.
p275_113|tony blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from dublin.
p275_114|the mood is upbeat.
p275_115|in the current outbreak the reverse is true.
p275_116|it's not fair.
p275_117|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p275_118|it is rubbish.
p275_119|who would be a referee?
p275_120|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p275_121|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p275_122|who would have?
p275_123|that's all right then.
p275_124|i wouldn't have wanted any other way.
p275_125|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p275_126|she really suffered for her art.
p275_127|it is not a u turn.
p275_128|offered the gold medal he declined.
p275_129|who will attend?
p275_130|twaddle is a case in point.
p275_131|the bbc was a disgrace.
p275_132|i am now unemployed.
p275_133|she said she would not welcome the flowers.
p275_134|it plans to return to this field.
p275_135|what will happen then?
p275_136|it's not true.
p275_137|police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p275_138|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p275_139|it was very frightened and dirty.
p275_140|we are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p275_141|is that it?
p275_142|if people are genuine then the problem is not osama bin laden.
p275_143|it seems so long since i did the exams.
p275_144|on friday the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p275_145|who would be right?
p275_146|no one in downing street can speak the language of the unions.
p275_147|he realises his mistake.
p275_148|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p275_149|i was awful.
p275_150|we have the location which is assured.
p275_151|he sets the nature of his parliament in a simple realistic context.
p275_152|initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p275_153|i am just trying to do my job.
p275_154|so i got a blood test.
p275_155|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p275_156|but he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p275_157|the weather forecast isn't good.
p275_158|it's amazing but i have never seen a drug test in scotland.
p275_159|they have not been named.
p275_160|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p275_161|it was by the numbers.
p275_162|she also defended the lord chancellor's existing powers.
p275_163|for the refugees the return will not come a moment too soon.
p275_164|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p275_165|well he should know.
p275_166|was this element always there?
p275_167|these days are long gone.
p275_168|i was in the train station overnight.
p275_169|we've all had the shots.
p275_170|tell it like it was?
p275_171|seven people were later detained by police.
p275_172|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p275_173|you had to go and see him.
p275_174|in a way he was.
p275_175|one season they might do well.
p275_176|is saddam a threat?
p275_177|as we worked.
p275_178|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p275_179|it is not either national standards or local control.
p275_180|he deserved the win.
p275_181|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p275_182|tony had arrived.
p275_183|the conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p275_184|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p275_185|his name was unknown.
p275_186|it's an idea.
p275_187|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p275_188|four policemen were wounded.
p275_189|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p275_190|what has caused the demise of singing?
p275_191|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p275_192|it is a farce.
p275_193|peace was won.
p275_194|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p275_195|yet the data is compelling.
p275_196|i came home by ambulance.
p275_197|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p275_198|i have a cold.
p275_199|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p275_200|tommy is not a problem.
p275_201|who will pay for this?
p275_203|but she might be.
p275_205|some realism was needed about the time resources and management.
p275_207|i don't want to use it.
p275_208|feel the heat?
p275_209|he knows a lot.
p275_210|you have a plan?
p275_211|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p275_212|it had all been arranged.
p275_213|so far the scheme has not been used in scotland.
p275_214|it s all change at kilmarnock.
p275_215|he seemed to lose his focus.
p275_216|work has started.
p275_217|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p275_218|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p275_219|he said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p275_220|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p275_221|during the communist time they were very privileged.
p275_222|we could easily be cut again.
p275_223|saturday is gone.
p275_224|it's the tate.
p275_225|clearly the stakes are high.
p275_226|i will win.
p275_227|the report is due out next month.
p275_228|i am very sorry that alastair campbell has taken this decision.
p275_229|he is in the queue.
p275_230|my wife and family are the support system.
p275_231|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p275_233|the parties have been given until today to respond.
p275_234|of course i was tempted.
p275_235|we will treat it like a world cup match.
p275_236|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p275_237|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p275_238|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p275_239|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p275_240|it is hard won.
p275_241|our policy is clear.
p275_242|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p275_243|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p275_244|i was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p275_246|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p275_247|it was a hit.
p275_248|the government in westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p275_249|i can't get a job.
p275_250|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p275_251|kirkwood was arrested.
p275_252|certainly in terms of league position we must be favourites.
p275_253|it will now relate to all public bodies in scotland.
p275_254|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p275_255|is that a serious question?
p275_256|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p275_257|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p275_258|souter will be back.
p275_259|blood samples were taken.
p275_260|they want to shut the scottish office.
p275_261|it will be done in stages.
p275_262|this is a question of islam.
p275_263|that review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
p275_264|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p275_265|it's very nice.
p275_266|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p275_268|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p275_269|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p275_270|it was very fast.
p275_271|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p275_272|his place in central defence was taken by john anderson.
p275_273|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p275_274|it's so awful.
p275_275|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p275_276|we are a grandmother.
p275_277|he looked very sharp.
p275_278|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p275_279|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p275_280|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p275_281|you've got to have both sides.
p275_282|it was a virus.
p275_283|yet it worked.
p275_284|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p275_285|it was good.
p275_286|who did the recruiting?
p275_287|police were on the scene within minutes but the killer had fled.
p275_288|bombing slaughter rejected
p275_289|we are not going to forget.
p275_290|i could never be cool.
p275_291|who can predict?
p275_292|there was a vacuum.
p275_293|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p275_294|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p275_295|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p275_296|she is really magic.
p275_297|one was a lawyer.
p275_298|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p275_299|there were no passengers on board.
p275_300|it could work.
p275_301|this is a war over our home.
p275_302|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p275_303|the court had a number of empty seats.
p275_304|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p275_305|the plot is minimal.
p275_306|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p275_307|there's no evidence he was ever there.
p275_308|you should be.
p275_309|the minister is the engineer.
p275_310|the letters are going out today.
p275_311|i will not allow the destruction of the scottish fishing industry.
p275_312|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p275_313|the premier league has been a huge success.
p275_314|we have got to get the points from this one.
p275_315|my whole life has changed.
p275_316|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p275_317|kids are terrible.
p275_320|we are in the end game.
p275_321|our message was inclusive.
p275_322|off with their heads.
p275_323|the figures are bad but not that bad.
p275_324|my view has now completely changed.
p275_325|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p275_326|is that an issue?
p275_327|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p275_328|finally he paid for the movie.
p275_329|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p275_330|it's been hard.
p275_331|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p275_332|who will do it?
p275_333|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p275_334|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p275_335|he also insisted that no concession had been made to the french.
p275_336|in that case we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p275_337|we are the gateway to justice.
p275_338|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p275_339|yet for the money he was not the man of the match.
p275_340|this is a friendly match?
p275_341|i got a yellow card.
p275_342|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p275_343|tell us about it.
p275_344|there may be reasons for it.
p275_345|i believe the gap is nearly there.
p275_346|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p275_347|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p275_348|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p275_349|she is free.
p275_350|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p275_351|scottish parliament should set an example for westminster to follow.
p275_352|the pair are very much in love.
p275_353|it is not like us.
p275_354|instead he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p275_355|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p275_356|we will be homeless.
p275_357|that would help.
p275_358|it is a memorial.
p275_359|this is a club on the rise.
p275_360|all the investment is possible through the public sector.
p275_361|i was conceived in aberdeen.
p275_362|the death rates are still as high.
p275_363|he's been in a nursing home for two years.
p275_364|it's now down in black and white.
p275_365|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p275_366|they have not done so this season so far.
p275_367|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p275_368|there is no signature.
p275_369|i am a wealthy person.
p275_370|colour was at the core of his life.
p275_371|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p275_372|it is hard to understand.
p275_373|something is wrong.
p275_374|you can cope with it.
p275_375|it's a logical consequence of the formula.
p275_376|it was not hard to feel some sympathy for baxter yesterday.
p275_377|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p275_378|it is the old story.
p275_379|it looked like a river.
p275_380|it's a real problem.
p275_381|a parliament for england is the only way to redress the balance.
p275_382|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p275_383|it's like a basketball.
p275_384|well it did last time he was reminded.
p275_385|it can help.
p275_386|i love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
p275_387|they are good.
p275_388|i'm glad i came.
p275_389|but we are a young side.
p275_390|that set the tone.
p275_391|it was a breathtaking moment.
p275_392|what happened in the summer?
p275_393|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p275_394|there were no immediate reports of injuries.
p275_395|the prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p275_396|what was the difference between them?
p275_397|he will be judged by his actions.
p275_398|whether the high court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p275_399|it is an absolute nonsense.
p275_400|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p275_402|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p275_403|it might be.
p275_404|feel the air the space.
p275_405|he scored a touchdown.
p275_406|the package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p275_407|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p275_408|domestic disturbance is currently on general release.
p275_409|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p275_410|we went straight into the bedroom.
p275_411|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p275_413|i am extremely cautious.
p275_414|paris is not only young.
p275_415|that deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p275_416|he is to appeal.
p275_417|it all began as an accident.
p275_418|we have to expand.
p275_419|there is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p275_420|nine days later he suffered another attack.
p275_421|i know the worry over iraq.
p275_422|the document argues that culture is at the heart of scottish society.
p275_423|it's been a long long journey.
p275_424|we are now up against it.
p275_425|last year it was won by jack mcconnell the first minister.
p275_426|i want a career.
p275_427|he deserved a red card.
p275_428|and they replied.
p275_429|however he held out little hope that the government would take action.
p276_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p276_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p276_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p276_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p276_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p276_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p276_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p276_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p276_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p276_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p276_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p276_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p276_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p276_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p276_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p276_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p276_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p276_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p276_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p276_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p276_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p276_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p276_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p276_025|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p276_026|how are you sir ?
p276_027|so is that it then ?
p276_028|do i have a favourite ?
p276_029|what do we do ?
p276_030|they might have asked for goodness sake.
p276_031|smoking is also very important.
p276_032|we have the support of scottish natural heritage.
p276_033|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p276_034|he said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
p276_035|there was a rush of water.
p276_036|a fiver and i'll tell.
p276_037|we speak about the performance.
p276_038|she is employed on short term contracts.
p276_039|further management changes are planned.
p276_040|i can feel the sound inside.
p276_041|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p276_042|he is married with three children.
p276_043|i might well have done so already.
p276_044|this is slightly negative for inflation.
p276_045|and they had a case.
p276_046|we believe a third party was involved.
p276_047|mr darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p276_048|it carried a double message.
p276_049|overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p276_050|but not a penny has been paid.
p276_051|perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
p276_052|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p276_053|the head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p276_054|surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p276_055|this represents a tough game for us.
p276_056|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p276_057|among them are many criminals.
p276_058|and they removed a borderer.
p276_059|he is too weak to move.
p276_060|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p276_061|they desperately want some stability.
p276_062|everything is possible in football.
p276_063|we like being the underdogs.
p276_064|he looks like an afghan.
p276_065|this trend is likely to strengthen.
p276_066|he will need that machine.
p276_067|then they scored two goals to win.
p276_068|both banks are heavily involved in the scottish market.
p276_069|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p276_070|the labour party's not downbeat and neither is the labour government.
p276_071|let's not be too despondent.
p276_072|there was no safety net.
p276_073|the government does not go far enough.
p276_074|he phoned the number in the brochure.
p276_075|a spokeswoman for the law society of scotland said.
p276_076|he confirmed that the document was valid.
p276_077|the wingers must have felt the cold.
p276_078|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p276_079|i have made that offer.
p276_080|why do it otherwise ?
p276_081|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p276_082|so did she meet him ?
p276_083|so what is the campaign about ?
p276_084|the new deal will now be put to the officers.
p276_085|carlton also declined to comment last night.
p276_086|but the organisers refused to worry.
p276_087|webster was brought up in glasgow.
p276_088|dumfries and galloway council said it was not breaking the government's directions.
p276_089|autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p276_090|the two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p276_091|he admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p276_092|authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p276_093|funding needs to be long term.
p276_094|we should all be grateful.
p276_095|he's not getting into any games.
p276_096|the coach is a man who is very ambitious.
p276_097|we are talking about the outskirts of london.
p276_098|it was exactly four months away.
p276_099|this is equally relevant to the landowner.
p276_100|the farmer wants a new campaign.
p276_101|we are satisfied with this outcome.
p276_102|robin williams is very subdued.
p276_103|it wasn't possible to relax.
p276_104|context is also very important.
p276_105|there could be a way back.
p276_106|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p276_107|both sides have been hit by injury.
p276_108|people had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
p276_109|even the one she loved.
p276_110|talk of a crisis is absurd.
p276_111|he's been active in arabia.
p276_112|england were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p276_113|just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p276_114|it is sometimes like that.
p276_115|he was unprepared for this fight.
p276_116|i've had it for the exams.
p276_117|those people must be accountable.
p276_118|if they liked it then i'll be happy.
p276_119|it's very bad timing but it's happened.
p276_120|choice is a good thing.
p276_121|i am not very pleased.
p276_122|new zealand rugby is totally different.
p276_123|petrol prices were widely blamed.
p276_124|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p276_125|accordingly financial restructuring is required.
p276_126|many others are subjected to violence by men.
p276_127|basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p276_128|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p276_129|they lived for their children.
p276_130|potions said he would drive.
p276_131|diversions were put in place.
p276_132|the queen mother is dead.
p276_133|no one person or small group could be singled out.
p276_134|the excitement could hardly be contained.
p276_135|margins are also in retreat.
p276_136|dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p276_137|he had missed a penalty against the english.
p276_138|the outsourcing deal will take effect in september.
p276_139|i was deeply saddened by the death of donald dewar.
p276_140|it particularly increases under age drinking he claimed.
p276_141|cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
p276_142|we have always maintained that we would never abandon scottish football.
p276_143|absences should be carefully monitored.
p276_144|four meetings have previously been arranged.
p276_145|the rise in retail sales was the first since august.
p276_146|colin said you get through the day to day by looking at the future.
p276_147|we just have to adapt.
p276_148|are you from the rugby ?
p276_149|what happened in that game ?
p276_150|are you going to win ?
p276_151|was it the wife ?
p276_152|why change it ?
p276_153|and they all have a vote.
p276_154|but they must believe in themselves.
p276_155|gordon marshall was outstanding against us.
p276_156|token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
p276_157|we made a world record together.
p276_158|this is the logic of punishment assaults.
p276_159|but his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p276_160|that was the first time i worked with richard.
p276_161|they said so that i would look good in uniform.
p276_162|a good actor doesn't think.
p276_163|that's what happened against ayr.
p276_164|hopefully no one will suffer too badly.
p276_165|he removed the rubble with the help of passers by.
p276_166|it is a good lifestyle.
p276_167|before the game we went for a pint.
p276_168|city sentiment is in his favour.
p276_169|his job was not advertised.
p276_170|nato has left them with no other option.
p276_171|scottish enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p276_172|he was just like a godfather to it.
p276_173|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p276_174|yet the survey has been cautious.
p276_175|these people are now following their own unison agenda.
p276_176|it took five months to repair the damage.
p276_177|they exist in name alone.
p276_178|advice and counselling will be offered.
p276_179|you had better believe it.
p276_180|it was a sobering experience.
p276_181|i can see it now.
p276_182|there's still plenty time left.
p276_183|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p276_184|i've no idea how it works.
p276_185|the upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
p276_186|the festivals will be about having fun.
p276_187|this is a milestone in the modernisation of the scottish prosecution service.
p276_188|she is in good spirits.
p276_189|the changes took effect from june.
p276_190|as if that is an achievement.
p276_191|that will be the sweetness.
p276_192|sacking john redwood is a disaster.
p276_193|strathclyde police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p276_194|there was a fossil on screen.
p276_195|the protest will go ahead as planned.
p276_196|i did not concentrate on my performance.
p276_197|the feedback from them has been fantastic.
p276_198|that admission is not surprising.
p276_199|but he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
p276_200|however the problem is the timing.
p276_201|again he dismissed a merger with halifax.
p276_202|that was just one night.
p276_203|this is a frightening development.
p276_204|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p276_205|millions of british jobs depend on europe.
p276_206|sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p276_207|that is an entirely unacceptable position.
p276_208|my father died in childbirth.
p276_209|it is quite a thing to watch.
p276_210|this should begin in october.
p276_211|twaddle is a case in point.
p276_212|the yugoslav army will still be there.
p276_213|some promoters made insulting offers.
p276_214|we did what we had to do.
p276_215|the squad is too small.
p276_216|what do we want to do that for ?
p276_217|does the name matter ?
p276_218|how do you get it back ?
p276_219|what are you not good at ?
p276_220|i think therefore i am ?
p276_221|you've got to be vigilant.
p276_222|i learned that only yesterday.
p276_223|it's been a humbling year.
p276_224|nicolson is no stranger to the highlands.
p276_225|you are a gambling man.
p276_226|marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p276_227|my daughter is an adult.
p276_228|i would not say that.
p276_229|there was a fine line to tread.
p276_230|the refund is fully justified.
p276_231|i've been asked that already this morning on the radio.
p276_232|i never wanted a legal battle.
p276_233|it would make a lot of sense.
p276_234|it was started almost by accident.
p276_235|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p276_236|bottling is now the core business.
p276_237|she died at her home.
p276_238|had this been common practice ?
p276_239|what do they want us to do ?
p276_240|is it worth it ?
p276_241|does it matter ?
p276_242|how do you take them away ?
p276_243|frankly it was worth the booking.
p276_244|people have been wonderful beyond belief.
p276_245|we were right to be afraid.
p276_247|that group reported just before christmas.

p276_321|it caused a lot of upset.

p276_333|we are trying to clarify the issues.
p276_334|i was inspired by two things.
p276_335|the government has completely lost control of gm crops.
p276_336|movie stars are public property.
p276_337|it comes from reflection or thinking.

p276_394|he ended up a headmaster.
p276_395|north african countries are also seen as potential customers.
p276_396|he is obviously very dangerous.
p276_397|the most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p276_398|that remains the unanswered question.
p276_399|you should always be able to get out in some direction.

p276_426|they made such decisions in london.
p276_427|calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p276_428|it seems a waste of talents.
p276_429|low pay is endemic in the national health service.
p276_430|this would discourage investment and job creation.
p276_431|we have no information on iraq.

p276_433|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p276_434|the company declined to comment.

p276_437|i always savour the company of the voice.
p276_438|it tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.

p276_442|not many people like to do that.
p276_443|he now lives in fenwick in ayrshire.
p276_444|i might also completely change the routine.
p276_445|we accept the new rules.

p276_447|we go there with confidence.
p276_448|they are interior designers and architects.
p276_449|he was released after treatment.
p276_450|i rejected the idea of a separate residence.

p276_463|now we see no mention of rising rates.
p276_464|labour's scottish general secretary alex rowley was delighted yesterday.
p276_465|we are having a look.
p277_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p277_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p277_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p277_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p277_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p277_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p277_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p277_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p277_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p277_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p277_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p277_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p277_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p277_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p277_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p277_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p277_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p277_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p277_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p277_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p277_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p277_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p277_025|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p277_026|is this accurate?
p277_027|they have no history.
p277_028|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p277_029|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p277_030|there's a story too.
p277_031|this is the window.
p277_032|he was jailed for five years.
p277_033|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p277_034|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p277_035|then suddenly they weren't.
p277_036|was it worth it?
p277_037|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p277_038|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p277_039|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p277_040|they're just different.
p277_041|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p277_042|a quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p277_043|indeed he does.
p277_044|i did not see any reason to change the captain.
p277_045|he's just in it for himself.
p277_046|however the decision has been welcomed by scottish enterprise officials.
p277_047|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p277_048|we will push.
p277_049|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.

p277_068|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p277_069|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p277_070|they are real.

p277_072|that was a gold medal for certain.
p277_073|he was popular.
p277_074|but i've won both ways.
p277_075|there was an e mail.
p277_076|sounds like the sixth sense?
p277_077|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p277_078|painful but only because it's true.
p277_079|i had my suspicions.
p277_080|he was at home with his pals.
p277_081|it was magic.
p277_082|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p277_083|it is a job creation scheme.
p277_084|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p277_085|even the one she loved.
p277_086|today she has been released.
p277_087|he is in the queue.
p277_088|he liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p277_089|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p277_090|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p277_091|someone who cares
p277_092|by then he was walking on water.
p277_093|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p277_094|it is a blow.
p277_095|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p277_096|they lived for their children.
p277_097|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p277_098|today i couldn't run on it.
p277_099|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p277_100|i was a spectator that is as far as it goes.

p277_120|it is so sad.
p277_121|the mood is upbeat.
p277_122|it is rubbish.
p277_123|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p277_124|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p277_125|who would have?
p277_126|there were no grounds for his action.

p277_169|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p277_170|again we were lucky.
p277_171|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p277_172|does that put pressure on us?

p277_197|it was worth a photograph.
p277_198|they make a selective perception process.
p277_199|we have an election in eight days.
p277_200|even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p277_201|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p277_202|the proposals are to be debated on monday by city councillors.
p277_203|twaddle is a case in point.
p277_204|a grampian police spokesman said.
p277_205|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p277_206|in each case they were a goal down.
p277_207|i have wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p277_208|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p277_209|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.

p277_213|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p277_214|you should always be able to get out in some direction.
p277_215|it's not before time.
p277_216|the report is due out next month.
p277_217|but she was.
p277_218|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p277_219|at the time he was a living legend.
p277_220|they must do it.
p277_221|dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
p277_222|however no further action was taken by police.
p277_223|until they came to do it.
p277_224|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p277_225|well they were the unlucky ones.
p277_226|there is no excuse.
p277_228|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p277_229|but it's a subtle process.
p277_230|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p277_231|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p277_232|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p277_233|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p277_234|it is hard won.
p277_235|our policy is clear.
p277_236|the scene is about this?
p277_237|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p277_238|there wasn't a goal.
p277_239|i should think so too.
p277_240|there's the mix.
p277_241|the concerns are the same.
p277_242|i can't get a job.
p277_243|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p277_244|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p277_245|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p277_246|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p277_248|is that a serious question?
p277_249|this is the first step.
p277_250|they must play for each other.
p277_251|souter will be back.
p277_252|george w bush the us president condemned the attacks.
p277_253|blood samples were taken.

p277_256|this is a question of islam.
p277_257|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p277_258|immediate action must be taken.
p277_259|it's very nice.
p277_260|he was also married with two children.
p277_261|the system can work.
p277_262|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p277_263|we're in shock.
p277_264|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p277_265|it's a way of life.
p277_266|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p277_267|it was very fast.
p277_268|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p277_269|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p277_270|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p277_271|if not he should go home.
p277_272|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p277_273|he looked very sharp.
p277_274|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p277_275|all options are open.
p277_276|dialogue is the key.
p277_277|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p277_278|it was a virus.
p277_279|maloney is an engaging talent.
p277_280|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p277_281|this is a national crisis.
p277_282|it was good.
p277_283|who did the recruiting?
p277_284|bombing slaughter rejected
p277_285|the songs are just so good.
p277_286|the goals will come.
p277_287|there's a pause.
p277_288|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p277_289|i was the sheep.
p277_290|what has altered?
p277_291|i was brought up in a mining background.
p277_292|nothing is safe.
p277_293|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p277_294|one was a lawyer.
p277_295|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p277_296|they are wrong.
p277_297|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p277_298|the plot is minimal.
p277_299|you are the glory.
p277_300|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p277_301|the letters are going out today.
p277_302|we want to play at the worlds.
p277_303|he is also keen to win the european order of merit.
p277_304|my whole life has changed.
p277_305|we are a peaceful people.
p277_306|you may have a short memory.
p277_307|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p277_308|my body is clearly capable.
p277_309|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p277_310|it is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p277_311|a review is under way.
p277_312|it will work.
p277_313|i came into this world with nothing.
p277_314|it's too horrible to think.
p277_315|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p277_316|off with their heads.
p277_317|is there a new way forward?
p277_318|i was invited to work in germany.
p277_319|is that an issue?
p277_320|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p277_321|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p277_322|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p277_323|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p277_324|it sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p277_325|well it won't.
p277_326|these days are long gone.
p277_327|two people were interviewed.
p277_328|i've got no secret.
p277_329|the package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p277_330|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p277_331|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p277_332|yet for my money he was not the man of the match.
p277_333|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p277_334|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p277_335|he loves the big occasions.
p277_336|the performance was excellent.
p277_337|that has been lost.
p277_338|tell us about it.
p277_339|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p277_340|she said they would appeal.
p277_341|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p277_342|another case of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in scotland yesterday.
p277_343|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p277_344|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p277_346|as indeed they would be.
p277_347|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p277_348|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p277_349|we will be homeless.
p277_350|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p277_351|mr anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p277_352|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p277_353|there was a substantial explosion.
p277_354|not so it seems.
p277_355|he could make it.
p277_356|four policemen were wounded.
p277_357|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p277_358|it's now down in black and white.
p277_359|now though he has an incentive.
p277_360|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p277_361|they have not done so this season so far.
p277_362|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p277_363|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p277_364|so there we won.
p277_365|by that time however it was already too late.
p277_366|there is no signature.
p277_367|it was a funny game.
p277_368|he was the architect.
p277_369|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p277_370|i've never seen a game like it.
p277_371|i am a wealthy person.
p277_372|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p277_373|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p277_374|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p277_375|something is wrong.
p277_376|you can cope with it.
p277_377|i didn't know that i had a court appearance on wednesday.
p277_378|that's the name of the game though.
p277_379|since then he has played no active part in the company.
p277_380|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p277_381|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p277_382|at the last i found a bunker.
p277_383|yet the data is compelling.
p277_384|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p277_385|it's a real problem.
p277_386|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p277_387|i was in the train station overnight.
p277_388|it is unusual.
p277_389|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p277_390|it's like a basketball.
p277_391|well it did last time he was reminded.
p277_392|i love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p277_393|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p277_394|it was a kind of contempt.
p277_395|it was a breathtaking moment.
p277_396|the car was just there.
p277_397|it will take place in july.
p277_398|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p277_399|is that possible?
p277_400|but in fact the reverse is true.
p277_401|what was the difference between them?
p277_402|emotions were complex.
p277_403|then he laughs.
p277_404|whether the high court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p277_405|it is an absolute nonsense.
p277_406|they recorded their debut album in new york.
p277_407|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p277_408|he has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p277_409|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p277_410|feel the air the space.
p277_411|he got his degree.
p277_412|i reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p277_413|went on sale.
p277_414|but we finished the show.
p277_415|mentally you have to be tough.
p277_416|the people around me were fantastic.
p277_417|i wanted to help the poor people in edinburgh.
p277_418|it is legally binding.
p277_419|is there any prospect of this happening?
p277_420|there's been a mistake.
p277_421|we just got a phone call on saturday night.
p277_422|eriksson would have approved.
p277_423|i am extremely cautious.
p277_424|it was little else.
p277_425|it all began as an accident.
p277_426|the mod has denied any cover up.
p277_427|i know the worry over iraq.
p277_428|it was a lot of hard work but it wasn't difficult.
p277_429|now however it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p277_430|the document argues that culture is at the heart of scottish society.
p277_431|we are all equal.
p277_432|it's been a long long journey.
p277_433|we were used.
p277_434|last year it was won by jack mcconnell the first minister.
p277_435|however he held out little hope that the government would take action.
p277_436|they were not even allowed to see them.
p277_437|that brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p277_438|horses are drawn by ballot.
p277_439|it won the match.
p277_440|and it showed.
p277_441|the shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p277_442|i hate the word.
p277_443|who would be in that desert?
p277_444|i was lost.
p277_445|the children are fine.
p277_446|they have to come up with a solution.
p277_447|that was the first time i worked with richard.
p277_448|the whole region is in shock.
p277_449|when people talk about the beach boys and brian wilson.
p277_450|it was a total disaster.
p277_451|there will be no repeat of that performance that i can guarantee.
p277_452|i got a yellow card.
p277_453|stewart was the life and soul of the party.
p277_454|scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
p277_455|we're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p277_456|if they don't they should say so.
p277_457|it is a vicious circle.
p277_458|scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p277_459|she also defended the lord chancellor's existing powers.
p277_460|i'd love to be like peter.
p277_461|i am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p277_462|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p277_463|the consultants report commissioned by the previous government was not published.
p278_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p278_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p278_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p278_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p278_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p278_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p278_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p278_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p278_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p278_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p278_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p278_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p278_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p278_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p278_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p278_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p278_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p278_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p278_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p278_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p278_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p278_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p278_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p278_025|a shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p278_026|these decisions are not simple.
p278_027|life was like a timetable.
p278_028|she is employed on short term contracts.
p278_029|they have now been banned from celtic park for life.
p278_030|the director will be present.
p278_031|clark was desperate to return to the house of commons.
p278_032|if we cannot succeed in this endeavour then so be it.
p278_033|it carried a double message.
p278_034|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p278_035|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p278_036|several investments have already been made.
p278_037|it was a hell of a way to lose.
p278_038|among them are many criminals.
p278_039|the whole thing was filmed in hollywood.
p278_040|this will get their attention.
p278_041|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p278_042|well the climate has changed.
p278_043|must be prepared to use it.
p278_044|he looks like an afghan.
p278_045|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p278_046|how are you sir ?
p278_047|so is that it then ?
p278_048|do i have a favourite ?
p278_049|he will need that machine.
p278_050|i have learned from him.
p278_051|i had trouble with the producers.
p278_052|he also presented you bet
p278_053|people come to see the highlands.
p278_054|they are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
p278_055|we have not given up hope.
p278_056|she said she was really sorry.
p278_057|none has ever been found.
p278_058|let's hope that it does.
p278_059|the baby was later transferred to a hospital in glasgow.
p278_060|it was exactly four months away.
p278_061|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p278_062|only water is currently allowed.

p278_064|but it has been an amazing experience.
p278_065|the judge was really nice.
p278_066|the talks were announced yesterday by brian wilson the foreign office minister.
p278_067|the fans would love it.
p278_068|halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p278_069|the party is up for it.
p278_070|even the one she loved.
p278_071|it was a unanimous decision.
p278_072|it's all going to clear the debt.
p278_073|this view was echoed by the other scottish analyst.
p278_074|last week he was taken into hospital.
p278_075|petrol prices were widely blamed.
p278_076|by then he was walking on water.
p278_077|we have to offer value for money.
p278_078|it's so hard to shift.
p278_079|mr smith declined to comment.
p278_080|western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p278_081|that was a great performance by the team.
p278_082|he said a change in legislation was long overdue.
p278_083|the allegations were still under investigation he added.
p278_084|everyone had to play the game.
p278_085|it was worth a photograph.
p278_086|it was clear on thursday.
p278_087|it's not a holiday time for football players.
p278_088|but they must believe in themselves.
p278_089|we haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p278_090|however the intensive care unit at the southern general hospital was full.
p278_091|thomson is expected to manage the business.
p278_092|the palace said the queen was deeply saddened.
p278_093|it was some time before she found out he was safe.
p278_094|in the end we made too many errors.
p278_095|that time is not now however.
p278_096|we created so many chances.
p278_097|our house was very small.
p278_098|why do it otherwise ?
p278_099|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p278_100|so did she meet him ?
p278_101|so what is the campaign about ?
p278_102|and does it ?
p278_103|are you from the rugby ?
p278_104|had i heard ?
p278_105|athletics is on a roll in the country.
p278_106|we needed financial backing to get it off the ground.

p278_108|we have got a race.
p278_109|the music industry hasn't changed at all.

p278_114|i didn't think so either.
p278_115|it was located on the remote control.
p278_116|maybe this battle has been.
p278_117|that might help a bit.
p278_118|this is a milestone in the modernisation of the scottish prosecution service.
p278_119|ferguson will be a millionaire.
p278_120|you can spend money on housing.
p278_121|the hearing was due to continue today.
p278_122|there will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p278_123|however the problem is the timing.
p278_124|this is a frightening development.
p278_125|which can happen any time.
p278_126|it was not a finale he would want to remember.
p278_127|we had another last tuesday.
p278_128|i didn't feel under any pressure.
p278_129|this should begin in october.
p278_130|that first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p278_131|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.

p278_135|but he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.

p278_144|i have always loved the countryside.

p278_179|his team management was protective.
p278_180|you have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p278_181|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p278_182|the outcome is now in our own hands.
p278_183|i've been in two finals and i've got a medal.
p278_184|it is vital to clarify their role.

p278_188|that's not fair to the supporters.
p278_189|they need to look after themselves.
p278_190|i've always been like that.
p278_191|it could be done by experts and lawyers.
p278_192|they were seriously after him.
p278_193|but there's an upturn in the sector.
p278_194|it shows the strength of the roots.
p278_195|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p278_196|it caused a lot of upset.
p278_197|however this idea is never developed.

p278_253|it might be sad but it's a fact.

p278_279|i'd never run for them.
p278_280|it does not work that way in scottish football.
p278_281|their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p278_282|these figures are truly terrible.
p278_283|the merger was welcomed by tony blair.
p278_284|the stage was set for a showdown.
p278_285|this could put pressure on uk inflation.
p278_286|i'd like to report a murder.
p278_287|they want to shut the scottish office.

p278_290|i understand the security issue.

p278_332|much the same thing happens in a young company.
p278_333|they come to enjoy themselves.
p278_334|that meant the search was unlawful.
p278_335|and he goes with it.
p278_336|that reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
p278_337|we are on a four year mission.
p278_338|the letters are going out today.

p278_355|he was at school in devon.
p278_356|finally came the moment of truth.
p278_357|this might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p278_358|a crucial moment has arrived.
p278_359|in general terms the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p278_360|three years ago he would have been.
p278_361|but we welcome this document.
p278_362|it intends to do so on wednesday.
p278_363|his views are hardly surprising.
p278_364|he expected a conclusion by next thursday.
p278_365|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p278_366|we put our bid in last night.
p278_367|their condition is described as satisfactory.
p278_368|we're still the only ones in the high street.
p278_369|i was delighted to accept.
p278_370|a few days after making the video i went to the inquiry.
p278_371|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p278_372|the selection will be made by the international olympic committee next year.
p278_373|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p278_374|lord macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p278_375|he must have seen the movie.
p278_376|the parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p278_377|the major championships will always have a special place.
p278_378|that is a break with tradition.
p278_379|this decision is a farce.
p278_380|is it worth it ?
p278_381|does it matter ?
p278_382|how do you take them away ?
p278_383|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p278_384|after the match do you ?
p278_385|scrutiny by the european parliament is limited.
p278_386|in due course the deal was done.
p278_387|this remains the party's policy.
p278_388|they will fight for everything.
p278_389|tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p278_390|the team hadn't been picked.

p278_395|they have not got anyone.
p278_396|the law would appear to be on our side.

p278_399|the government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p278_400|there's still no one like him.
p278_401|they know it'll be fantastic.
p278_402|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p278_403|clark is back on top form.
p278_404|i had a fortunate war.
p278_405|we must improve our relations with government.
p278_406|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p278_407|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p278_408|that is the ultimate revenge.

p279_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p279_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.

p279_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p279_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p279_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p279_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p279_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p279_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p279_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p279_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p279_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p279_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p279_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p279_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p279_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p279_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p279_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p279_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p279_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p279_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p279_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p279_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p279_025|it's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p279_026|he said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p279_027|the main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p279_028|they should be so lucky.
p279_029|is this accurate?
p279_030|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p279_031|there's a story too.
p279_032|people love to see this stuff.

p279_044|it will come all right.

p279_076|the end result is precisely the same.
p279_077|it seemed so personal.
p279_078|painful but only because it's true.

p279_080|i've been there.
p279_081|they do not work for glasgow city council.

p279_095|this reason is to do with the nature of the scotland manager.

p279_097|until you hit the big games.
p279_098|the peace process will be buried

p279_100|we have always maintained that we would never abandon scottish football.

p279_103|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p279_104|i see no need for change.
p279_105|that would be unlawful.

p279_148|they did very well.
p279_149|you know the type.
p279_150|in each case they were a goal down.
p279_151|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p279_152|a final decision will be taken by first minister donald dewar.
p279_153|it was the same at twickenham.
p279_154|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p279_155|he then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p279_156|this latter point is hugely important.
p279_157|i am very happy with life.
p279_158|these days are long gone.
p279_159|it is an attitude of mind.
p279_160|but we have not heard a thing from diego.
p279_161|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p279_162|as indeed they would be.
p279_163|i have got a wife to feed.
p279_164|we do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p279_165|tell it like it was?
p279_166|it is not too late to get on board.
p279_167|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p279_168|by then however both men were already in the us.
p279_169|holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p279_170|nobody did in those days.
p279_171|my life has been destroyed.
p279_172|his team management was protective.
p279_173|is saddam a threat?
p279_174|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p279_175|but the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p279_176|it is not either national standards or local control.
p279_177|the clarity is vital.
p279_178|the hotel was now for sale.
p279_179|i drove the ball well.
p279_180|that has been the easy part.
p279_181|mr docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p279_182|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p279_183|government will intervene.
p279_184|we knew nothing about it.
p279_185|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p279_186|it's a portrait of glasgow not the portrait.
p279_187|it's a joke.
p279_188|does this matter?
p279_189|it just came into my head that day.
p279_190|my main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p279_191|it was an odd affair in many respects.
p279_192|it is tough but possible.
p279_193|we talk about mr michael johnson and he is awesome.
p279_194|the procedure is the same in all cases.
p279_195|neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p279_196|the appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p279_197|it was typical.
p279_198|our strategy is straightforward.
p279_199|there would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p279_200|i have a cold.
p279_201|tommy is not a problem.
p279_202|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p279_203|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p279_204|he had suffered a heart attack.
p279_205|the album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p279_206|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p279_207|some realism was needed about time resources and management.
p279_208|there was no rescue.
p279_209|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p279_210|i don't want to use it.
p279_211|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p279_212|the aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p279_213|the road was closed for several hours.
p279_214|that is an important part of our role.
p279_215|twaddle is a case in point.
p279_216|i am delighted for simon.
p279_217|by hard work is the answer.
p279_218|i have wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p279_219|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p279_220|his death was a tragic accident.
p279_221|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p279_222|he's a nice guy.
p279_223|but i felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p279_224|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p279_225|i am immensely sad.
p279_226|i'd never seen a play about me.
p279_228|my neighbours are horrified.
p279_229|at the time he was a living legend.
p279_230|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p279_231|they are the innocent victims.
p279_232|jim leighton will play in the scottish cup final.
p279_233|broke the birdie record.
p279_234|police later said the scheme would end in november.
p279_235|it is set in paris.
p279_236|they should come forward.
p279_237|it is not an option but a policy requirement.
p279_238|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p279_239|you take a risk.
p279_240|it's too much work.
p279_241|the court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p279_242|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p279_243|he will go a long way.
p279_244|we did not compete with any other local farmer.
p279_245|the scene is about this?
p279_246|it is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p279_247|we will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p279_248|he's a lovely young man.
p279_249|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p279_250|this year i understood.
p279_251|this is the culture change in medicine.
p279_252|he said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p279_253|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p279_254|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p279_255|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p279_256|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p279_257|this is a big club.
p279_258|blair is very positive at european councils.
p279_259|they fail to engage.
p279_260|people should not become complacent.
p279_261|the work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p279_262|the warning is timely.
p279_263|their findings are published in the journal injury prevention.
p279_264|blood samples were taken.
p279_265|it looks as though he will be right.
p279_266|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p279_267|i am totally horrified by the sentence.
p279_268|it's very nice.
p279_269|it left me with a sadness.
p279_270|it was an easy decision to come here.
p279_271|it is the same in sweden.
p279_272|that could be in place by next year.
p279_273|things can change.
p279_274|a search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p279_275|the script was funny.
p279_276|they seem to get away with it.
p279_277|she looked so young.
p279_278|it happens from time to time.
p279_279|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p279_280|they expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
p279_281|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p279_282|i intended to look for another club on loan.
p279_283|you've got to have both sides.
p279_284|the attacker died in the crash.
p279_285|it was a virus.
p279_286|maloney is an engaging talent.
p279_287|who will perform?
p279_288|it's like a high school play.
p279_289|it was hopeless.
p279_290|i asked for a positive response and i was given one.
p279_291|she said she could not believe that they had run away.
p279_292|he wrote the letter two days before he died.
p279_293|it changed my life.
p279_294|these figures are truly awful.
p279_295|he should have won.
p279_296|sunday's game was not a trial.
p279_297|right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p279_298|what has altered?
p279_299|graeme was prepared.
p279_300|i thought it was my only chance.
p279_301|one was a lawyer.
p279_302|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p279_303|they are wrong.
p279_304|this is a war over our home.
p279_305|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p279_306|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p279_307|it was entirely justified.
p279_308|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p279_309|it's certainly different.
p279_310|the letters are going out today.
p279_311|i did not name it.
p279_312|the government in westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p279_313|special measures were needed.
p279_314|it is all credit to them today.
p279_315|they were fantastic.
p279_316|craig is a major concern for us.
p279_317|my body is clearly capable.
p279_318|i came into this world with nothing.
p279_319|the airport was even different.
p279_320|hopefully he will get a lucky break.
p279_321|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p279_322|he got the same story.
p279_323|they also recovered a picture of osama bin laden.
p279_324|he was then replaced by ross.
p279_325|she did not attend the courtroom.
p279_326|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p279_327|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p279_328|was this element always there?
p279_329|they haven't got a hope.
p279_330|he did a good job.
p279_331|i'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p279_332|it is so unfair.
p279_333|it will be very very tight.
p279_334|that is the very reason why it was so vital.
p279_335|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p279_336|the composer will conduct.
p279_337|it's always nice to play on centre court.
p279_338|alex ferguson is the same.
p279_339|the boat was fantastic.
p279_340|i was pleased to be back on the podium in brazil.
p279_341|like his acting it was an accident.
p279_342|a few days after making the video i went to the inquiry.
p279_343|you need a licence to run a pub.
p279_344|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p279_345|the salary changes are long overdue.
p279_346|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p279_347|it is horrible.
p279_348|the pressure is on celtic in the main.
p279_349|i kept going for her.
p279_350|he has seen the past.
p279_351|hartley should know.
p279_352|we are looking for perfection.
p279_353|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p279_354|it's that sort of night.
p279_355|he could make it.
p279_356|saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p279_357|i lost my head.
p279_358|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p279_359|it was a double tragedy for the family.
p279_360|he put some colour into scottish history.
p279_361|well the big day has arrived.
p279_362|so there we won.
p279_363|by that time however it was already too late.
p279_364|breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p279_365|there is no signature.
p279_366|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p279_367|there is no evidence of a little scotland emerging.
p279_368|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p279_369|he has the edge.
p279_370|again we were lucky.
p279_371|he denied the charge.
p279_372|stevenson was arrested on monday morning.
p279_373|it has been a lovely family occasion.
p279_374|that's the name of the game though.
p279_375|you thought it was a headache.
p279_376|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p279_377|we have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p279_378|it doesn't always work that way.
p279_379|i'm pleased about one thing.
p279_380|we try to keep it right.
p279_381|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p279_382|it's like a basketball.
p279_383|stewart will travel with some confidence.
p279_384|i can lead by example.
p279_385|he repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p279_386|he is on the wrong side.
p279_387|it will probably take me just days to spend it.
p279_388|i was in jail for five years.
p279_389|it will take place in july.
p279_390|however bbc scotland was not interested in his work.
p279_391|the orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p279_392|i never won a penny throughout my career.
p279_393|his remarks appear to have had an effect.
p279_394|he's already made history.
p279_395|so i did.
p279_396|you ask the question.
p279_397|not because they want to sing about something.
p279_398|you make the choice.
p279_399|i have been in good form for the last two years.
p279_400|a new leader is unlikely to be chosen before september.
p279_401|nobody even knew it had happened.
p279_402|what would be the point?
p279_403|the weekly average was three hours.
p279_404|quality meat scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p279_405|the visual arts committee took this decision in december.
p279_406|senior management in scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p280_001|please call stella.
p280_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p280_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p280_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p280_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p280_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p280_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p280_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p280_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p280_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p280_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p280_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p280_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p280_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p280_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p280_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p280_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p280_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p280_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p280_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p280_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p280_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p280_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p280_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p280_025|he has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p280_026|his secretary said it was a matter for murray financial to deal with.
p280_027|i've got the same feeling as i had last week in germany.
p280_028|the west coast line is not just for middle england.
p280_029|the budget is a boost for scottish business.
p280_030|she brought a lot to my life.
p280_031|things fall a little flat elsewhere however.
p280_032|thomson and his family left court without comment.
p280_033|i want to give everything to rangers while i am with the club.
p280_034|but the sunday herald said it stood by its story.
p280_035|it is about control of our economy.
p280_036|each brand was owned by a different family.
p280_037|that was not perfect golf by any means.
p280_038|he added that her comments were noted.
p280_039|she will get through it i'm sure.
p280_040|everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p280_041|hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p280_042|he does not even trust his own members.
p280_043|he too started on the subs seats.
p280_044|is it worth it ?
p280_045|does it matter ?
p280_046|how do you take them away ?
p280_047|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p280_048|after the match do you ?
p280_049|has the conflict started ?
p280_050|have i really come to this ?
p280_051|i'm as fit as i can get.
p280_052|we took part in a festival called global dance.
p280_053|he said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p280_054|the important retail business continues to deliver excellent results stewart said.
p280_055|andy was a huge influence yet again.
p280_056|they seem too much of a sure thing.
p280_057|her husband had been waiting for her return.
p280_058|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p280_059|we just want this season to end.
p280_060|it was a day she thought she would never see.
p280_061|talks have continued at many different levels.
p280_062|the referee is there to decide these things.
p280_063|there were no details of the other five victims.
p280_064|it also has a good labour supply.
p280_065|indeed he has a lot of output.
p280_066|do not give your details to anyone.
p280_067|he was failed by his health authority.
p280_068|but it was not all bad news.
p280_069|i cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p280_070|but during the bid process that changed completely.
p280_071|it turned me against the whole system.
p280_072|she seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p280_073|i saw the story but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p280_074|but two groups refused to sign up.
p280_075|i was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p280_076|it had little effect on european equity markets.
p280_077|i'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p280_078|the key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p280_079|the squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p280_080|they said our costs were too high.
p280_081|i do not attempt to answer that.
p280_082|it's been a great evening for us.
p280_083|that kind of growth is the important thing.
p280_084|a regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p280_085|no plans for projects are yet in place.
p280_086|clearly he knows nothing about glasgow or glasgow green.
p280_087|i have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p280_088|celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p280_089|i feel i did not have enough time.
p280_090|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p280_091|i can't remember a lot about the accident.
p280_092|clark was delighted with the effort of jones.
p280_093|they had the appeal of tv stars.
p280_094|there is no issue of national security involved here.
p280_095|he will be a very hard act to follow.
p280_096|earlier both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p280_097|put simply it goes something like this.
p280_098|over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p280_099|even if he doesn't have any lines.
p280_100|i am delighted to hear this news.
p280_101|we are already seeing some positive results.
p280_102|we will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p280_103|we were under a bit of pressure.
p280_104|they won't actually make any money from it.
p280_105|i bought a flat six years ago.
p280_106|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p280_107|they are a different team at home.
p280_108|it took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p280_109|scotland is never far away at westminster.
p280_110|some young girls also came by last night.
p280_111|former hamilton defender colin miller could return to the club today as manager.
p280_112|what are they for ?
p280_113|is there a waiting list ?
p280_114|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p280_115|so what happens next ?
p280_116|had this been common practice ?
p280_117|what do they want us to do ?
p280_118|the idea is the shop within a shop.
p280_119|i left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p280_120|it is the right package for scotland.
p280_121|they have no real friends in the region.
p280_122|england were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p280_123|just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p280_124|in glasgow a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
p280_125|i think there's not much between them.
p280_126|so i am going in the right direction.
p280_127|now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p280_128|we have to offer value for money.
p280_129|it's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p280_130|i could live without the attention he admitted.
p280_131|he's got to look after himself now.
p280_132|he said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p280_133|no country has a similar training programme.
p280_134|there is no future in rock music.
p280_135|her research is the second piece by edinburgh university scientists highlighted recently.
p280_136|therefore no one can work full time in these companies.
p280_137|the chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p280_138|we must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p280_139|the programme has been made with great care.
p280_140|there was only one living room you see.
p280_141|i am not under any new pressure.
p280_142|the allegations were still under investigation he added.
p280_143|it appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p280_144|they can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p280_145|all eight victims were based in germany.
p280_146|look george w bush will come here in two months.
p280_147|you should feel involved in their lives.
p280_148|it is open season on the old firm.
p280_149|is it in the right place ?
p280_150|did he trip ?
p280_151|does that put pressure on us ?
p280_152|did it work ?
p280_153|do you think we are a top nation ?
p280_154|three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p280_155|time may already have run out for this option.
p280_156|no contact was made although the arm was clearly raised.
p280_157|when it happened he could hardly believe it.
p280_158|they let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p280_159|as our national coach brown is done for.
p280_160|a progress report will be published in october.
p280_161|this man could yet win over scottish hearts.
p280_162|that will reduce my chance of selection.
p280_163|when germany played there recently the match took place in the new stadium.
p280_164|surely it can't run for two years.
p280_165|but the game is still wide open.
p280_166|it is no good thinking about rangers at this time.
p280_167|however it's possible that dick can influence some dutch players to go there.
p280_168|i knew that i needed to lower my ball flight.
p280_169|we had to work very hard for our points.
p280_170|that is a big risk at any price.
p280_171|you need a long term strategy in football.
p280_172|he said some things which were better left alone.
p280_173|if successful several records will be made.
p280_174|the company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p280_175|it didn't come as any great surprise.
p280_176|finally we decided to put the whole speech in.
p280_177|it's just a different way of life.
p280_178|therefore this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p280_179|nato has left them with no other option.
p280_180|i am secure in my own position.
p280_181|traffic was also heavy around strathclyde park.
p280_182|she is believed to be in south africa.
p280_183|the answer i hope includes the government holyrood and westminster.
p280_184|we have come a long way since then.
p280_185|i made my mind up before we came on tour.
p280_186|a great player has to win major championships.
p280_187|highland health board has a responsibility here.
p280_188|i didn't miss the big house at all.
p280_189|the story was not made public by this club.
p280_190|that capital would be provided equally by the state and established commercial companies.
p280_191|you are not long home from work.
p280_192|i am fighting the force of nature.
p280_193|it involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p280_194|murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p280_195|and they were being paid ?
p280_196|was everything done to save people ?
p280_197|what was the matter for concern ?
p280_198|but they had to be paid for.
p280_199|there was no way back for rangers after that blow.
p280_200|the police insisted that they were standard issue.
p280_201|one in eight workers in edinburgh works for standard life alone.
p280_202|i've never had a year like this.
p280_203|full details are expected to be released in june.
p280_204|as you see with the fuel duty business they do.
p280_205|hague will be leader at the election after next.
p280_206|he is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p280_207|i want an answer from the british government.
p280_208|gas production was also at record levels last year.
p280_209|they are a victim of their own success.
p280_210|we knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p280_211|this is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p280_212|it is going to change the world.
p280_213|scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the scotland manager.
p280_214|people elsewhere in scotland will feel cut off by this.
p280_215|the study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p280_216|i am not going to judge them.
p280_217|i do not see this so much as failure.
p280_218|a european final must be the millennium target.
p280_219|scotland will not vote for new labour next time.
p280_220|i was independent but i am not now.
p280_221|we hope for a fresh board with a fresh clear look at things.
p280_222|we are still seeking that complete performance.
p280_223|my targets for the scottish conservative party are high.
p280_224|someone should force president bush to watch this film.
p280_225|the price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p280_226|if not a deal could take many months.
p280_227|this takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p280_228|royal bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p280_229|i want to see as much progress as possible.
p280_230|this is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p280_231|i felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p280_232|the mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p280_233|they should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p280_234|the labour side has developed in the north area.
p280_235|you are not allowed to do that.
p280_236|that is the last thing they need.
p280_237|he has worked for several years in the united states.
p280_238|the children were later able to leave by bus.
p280_239|jim was down there with his wife.
p280_240|was it the wife ?
p280_241|why change it ?
p280_242|what do we want to do that for ?
p280_243|does the name matter ?
p280_244|how do you get it back ?
p280_245|what are you not good at ?
p280_246|i think therefore i am ?
p280_247|church leaders warned other homes could close.
p280_248|the pair will meet again in glasgow and then train together in australia.
p280_249|my first new year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p280_250|he has many offers from the english premiership.
p280_251|however the figures tell a different story.
p280_252|the rise has come too late for some.
p280_253|rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p280_254|i'd rather play well next week than here.
p280_255|edinburgh prison will also require to be seen.
p280_256|the british government should follow the irish example.
p280_257|commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p280_258|despite his success things began to fall apart.
p280_259|policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p280_260|and they never show the same film as a rival.
p280_261|every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p280_262|there would be a north and south division.
p280_263|the same trend showed up throughout britain.
p280_264|the two companies were not for sale.
p280_265|his condition was described as serious last night.
p280_266|the full cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p280_267|the board do not own the company.
p280_268|last night bush carried it rather easily.
p280_269|they always want to give a performance.
p280_270|its primary business channel is the internet.
p280_271|that's been the difference between the sides.
p280_272|the lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p280_273|i think i was about four years old.
p280_274|meanwhile the trust presented its first grant awards for scotland yesterday.
p280_275|it is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p280_276|despite labour's recent problems it has not been able to do that.
p280_277|i think the shares are good value.
p280_278|one letter from a teacher arrived at christmas.
p280_279|yesterday's session was the last full one before christmas.
p280_280|the life office will now stay with abbey.
p280_281|analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p280_282|overall the last hole was good to the women.
p280_283|he may be ready for first team action in march.
p280_284|the fans pay for their season tickets.
p280_285|there was just fire all around me.
p280_286|in fact i have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p280_287|wall street provided the british market with little fresh direction.
p280_288|no one had seen this sort of thing before.
p280_289|we played well at aberdeen though we lost.
p280_290|he has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p280_291|he would get into any world team.
p280_292|its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p280_293|they first met during a step in london.
p280_294|the agreement remains the only show in town.
p280_295|the question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p280_296|the strong performance is expected to continue.
p280_297|local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p280_298|it is based on population rather than need.
p280_299|he could understand both points of view.
p280_300|so did she meet him ?
p280_301|so what is the campaign about ?
p280_302|and does it ?
p280_303|are you from the rugby ?
p280_304|had i heard ?
p280_305|what happened in that game ?
p280_306|are you going to win ?
p280_307|it might have led to a screen career but it didn't.
p280_308|further heavy charges are expected this year.
p280_309|it had happened on average once a week this year.
p280_310|this is the version which appeared in our paper.
p280_311|he is keen to stay in public service.
p280_312|of course people will try the things they see on tv.
p280_313|for that reason cover should not be given.
p280_314|he felt too close to head office.
p280_315|if you believe in the blue and white.
p280_316|a report on their property is due within days.
p280_317|he will just go on doing his job.
p280_318|i always felt they played for me.
p280_319|that's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p280_320|the team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p280_321|this term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p280_322|we will not simply hit these people.
p280_323|we still think this trade is on the increase.
p280_324|it is not either national standards or local control.
p280_325|his name was first linked last year to business for scotland.
p280_326|i feel as if i can hole everything now.
p280_327|i try to be open to experience.
p280_328|he is not exactly a pretty child.
p280_329|i thought the race was a little bit slow.
p280_330|if i didn't go for the world record i'd feel guilty.
p280_331|having a scot play against us would not achieve that.
p280_332|i felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p280_333|these options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p280_334|one royal however was himself criticised yesterday.
p280_335|sports secretary chris smith welcomed the action.
p280_336|i hope numbers will be up on last time.
p280_337|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p280_338|how are you sir ?
p280_339|so is that it then ?
p280_340|do i have a favourite ?
p280_341|put another way they just won't do it.
p280_342|perhaps she met her husband too early she says.
p280_343|getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p280_344|martin o neill called this game almost exactly right.
p280_345|neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p280_346|it was a bit like having children.
p280_347|and the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p280_348|and that is the bottom line box office.
p280_349|i'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p280_350|i think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p280_351|i think we are back on track.
p280_352|sales will begin by the end of october.
p280_353|the executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p280_354|friday night was a pretty good night.
p280_355|it is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p280_356|the deal is expected to be completed by september.
p280_357|it is the only natural british site on the list.
p280_358|his style was direct and very human.
p280_359|under alex ferguson aberdeen showed it could be done.
p280_360|they have the cash and the fire power.
p280_361|the institute board will take the decision.
p280_362|he's young enough and he must learn.
p280_363|such a policy is for long term strength.
p280_364|both players gave so much to the side.
p280_365|stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p280_366|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p280_367|the dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p280_368|it was a goal which came from nothing.
p280_369|we have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p280_370|i have come here to show support for the families.
p280_371|we have been going for three years.
p280_372|he really played us into a corner.
p280_373|they know the truth they really know the truth.
p280_374|it was another black day for ayrshire.
p280_375|otherwise we might as well hold it now.
p280_376|it used to be all hard sell.
p280_377|the direct effects on trade will be limited.
p280_378|he had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p280_379|he would discuss the peace process in northern ireland.
p280_380|this is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p280_381|this is not a small amount of money.
p280_383|i just felt that i was broken down.
p280_384|what do we do ?
p280_385|why do it otherwise ?
p280_386|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p280_387|the cost of this failure will not hit the commission.
p280_388|similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p280_389|he remains a main board director of royal.
p280_390|his record on government has always been highly effective.
p280_391|my tax affairs have been totally open.
p280_392|five years ago its return was rejected.
p280_393|but soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p280_394|in my opinion any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p280_395|in that situation they thought we should be beaten.
p280_396|we are keen to see truth and justice.
p280_397|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p280_398|people have a wish to charge twice.
p280_399|i think it's a big advantage to us.
p280_400|there were no hard words between us.
p280_401|today he will meet the italian press but he will give little away.
p280_402|every blood test on sheep in scotland has been completely clear.
p280_403|these old songs are very nice to play.
p280_404|my views on the decision are well known.
p280_405|i'd never seen a play about me.
p280_406|we were on top and could have won.
p280_407|some would say that that culture had been created already.
p280_408|so it looks like a done deal.
p280_409|the play was to go straight ahead.
p280_410|at the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
p281_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p281_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p281_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p281_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p281_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p281_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p281_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p281_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p281_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p281_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p281_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p281_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p281_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p281_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p281_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p281_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p281_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p281_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p281_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p281_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p281_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p281_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p281_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p281_025|she is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p281_026|they are very clever in their use of words.
p281_027|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p281_028|smoking is also very important.
p281_029|it's not going to work out that way.
p281_030|they've got their own agenda.
p281_031|i'd just like to play.
p281_032|our fans have been marvellous.
p281_033|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p281_034|he should emerge as the winner.
p281_035|she failed in her action.
p281_036|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p281_037|it carried a double message.
p281_038|it is a financial matter.
p281_039|this film will be totally awesome.
p281_040|they want to be entertained.
p281_041|a week is a long time in politics.
p281_042|i am just going to go for it.
p281_043|there's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p281_044|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p281_045|among them are many criminals.
p281_046|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p281_047|he looks like an afghan.
p281_048|that was the theory anyway.
p281_049|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p281_050|i had come back from london.
p281_051|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p281_052|the cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p281_053|i must take a seat.
p281_054|that is very hard alone.
p281_055|the government should be ashamed.
p281_056|none has ever been found.
p281_057|there will be no repeat of that performance that i can guarantee.
p281_058|we should be able to cope.
p281_059|it was a lovely experience.
p281_060|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p281_061|we will pay their bills.
p281_062|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p281_063|the standard is extremely high.
p281_064|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p281_065|only water is currently allowed.
p281_066|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p281_067|it is a real problem.
p281_068|i have proved that in the past.
p281_069|he had been a singer.
p281_070|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p281_071|how are you sir ?
p281_072|so is that it then ?
p281_073|do i have a favourite ?
p281_074|the players will be down.
p281_075|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p281_076|there could be a lot of confusion.
p281_077|he also received a medal of honour.
p281_078|halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p281_079|mini rugby is a great thing.
p281_080|he is in the queue.
p281_081|i first met him last summer.
p281_082|last week he was taken into hospital.
p281_083|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p281_084|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p281_085|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p281_086|the error appeared in a warrant.
p281_087|he liked the weather the courses the food.
p281_088|the cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p281_089|it is called a killing in the trade.
p281_090|it was worth a photograph.
p281_091|we could not get any possession.
p281_092|officers recovered a second body in the area.
p281_093|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p281_094|the conclusion is the same.
p281_095|it is a vicious circle.
p281_096|but i know the course.
p281_097|we must stop it with the golf ball.
p281_098|we live by the rule of law.
p281_099|this is a national crisis.
p281_100|otherwise the market may come back.
p281_101|the following are the principal provisions.
p281_102|movement has to take place.
p281_103|city sentiment is in his favour.
p281_104|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p281_105|it's not a lack of confidence.
p281_106|it was a funny game.
p281_107|what do we do ?
p281_108|why do it otherwise ?
p281_109|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p281_110|that is the only way forward.
p281_111|they are at a very early stage.
p281_112|the whole thing is the music.
p281_113|or it would have been.
p281_114|his is a success story by any standard.
p281_115|its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p281_116|such actions are rarely popular.
p281_117|i've heard this stuff about the markets.
p281_118|it is much as it has been described.
p281_119|they've got to account for it.
p281_120|then again we could have.
p281_121|we have a training class.
p281_122|lady thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p281_123|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p281_124|it has removed a bit of guilt.

p281_270|that could be in place by next year.
p281_271|on the contrary they stand to gain.
p281_272|he looked like a schoolboy.
p281_273|england could only play the other team on the park.

p281_279|we are aiming for early march.
p281_280|it is also very valuable.

p281_330|it's difficult to predict the future.
p281_331|it looks as though the issue with the scotsman is too sensitive.
p281_332|but the farmer is bemused.
p281_333|to beat the european champion is quite nice.
p281_334|however the groups denied the claims.
p281_335|the airport was even different.
p281_336|there was no time scale.
p281_337|does that put pressure on us ?
p281_338|did it work ?
p281_339|do you think we are a top nation ?

p281_348|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p281_349|the idea was first mooted a year ago.
p281_350|he did a good job.
p281_351|it's a policy which has worked for us.
p281_352|it intends to do so on wednesday.
p281_353|i think this proposal is excellent.
p281_354|the allies intend to maintain the average.

p281_368|the major championships will always have a special place.
p281_369|she said they would appeal.

p281_386|in fact he was great today.
p281_387|now though he has an incentive.
p281_388|a review is under way.
p281_389|it is a simple equation.
p281_390|we have to reinforce the pressure on iraq.

p281_396|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p281_397|that investment has now been secured.

p281_406|he took a draw on his cigarette.
p281_407|it was the same expression of joy.
p281_408|there is a solution she believes.
p281_409|yet the data is compelling.
p281_410|that was a touch of class.
p281_411|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p281_412|that is a personal matter.
p281_413|he seems to be used to the attention.
p281_414|we will stand for the nation.
p281_415|is it worth it ?
p281_416|does it matter ?
p281_417|how do you take them away ?
p281_418|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p281_419|after the match do you ?
p281_420|i am delighted for them.
p281_421|footballers have also been targeted.
p281_422|in time may prove a worthy successor to billy dodds.
p281_423|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p281_424|my aim is a top six finish.
p281_425|that's the way it works.
p281_426|the professor is in no doubt.
p281_427|it was a poor performance.
p281_428|this news came after the stock market closed on monday.
p281_429|john daly has a burning ambition.
p281_430|once again they would be wrong.
p281_431|together we can make a difference.
p281_432|he will be judged by his actions.
p281_433|it is an absolute nonsense.
p281_434|we might be back next year.
p281_435|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p281_436|size is not the issue.
p281_437|it was support as it should be.
p281_438|i didn't get to keep it.
p281_439|it is never easy to win an olympic gold medal.
p281_440|the boy in the sixth sense is not alone.
p281_441|he deserves a second chance.
p281_442|it is pretty bad news.
p281_443|we just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p281_444|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p281_445|we just got a phone call on saturday night.
p281_446|but we have built a platform for next season.
p281_447|i was embarrassed by it.
p281_448|that's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p281_449|she came to the highland show.
p281_450|neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner up.
p281_451|we have the location which is assured.
p281_452|they were good years for him.
p281_453|we're all paying for it.
p281_454|this is the stuff of live music.
p281_455|she has now been registered as disabled.
p281_456|we could hardly believe it.
p281_457|the men are very worried.
p281_458|both promotions come as no surprise.
p281_459|we are going through the process.
p281_460|it must never be seen as second class.
p282_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p282_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p282_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p282_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p282_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p282_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p282_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p282_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p282_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p282_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p282_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p282_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p282_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p282_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p282_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p282_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p282_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p282_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p282_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.she is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p282_025|but it failed.
p282_026|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p282_027|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p282_028|however the following year the cancer returned.
p282_029|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p282_030|this is the window.
p282_031|he was jailed for five years.
p282_032|help is needed.
p282_033|then suddenly they weren't.
p282_034|it is marvellous.
p282_035|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p282_036|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p282_037|they're just different.
p282_038|it was clear.
p282_039|indeed he does.
p282_040|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p282_041|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p282_042|dancing was her life.
p282_043|the ambition this year is to improve on last.
p282_044|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p282_045|they want to be entertained.
p282_046|it's the only thing.
p282_047|you had better believe it.
p282_048|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p282_049|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p282_050|a neighbour said.
p282_051|it is bizarre.
p282_052|there is no reason at all.
p282_053|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p282_054|every aspect of our play was first class.
p282_055|our people are ready.
p282_056|here's a clue.
p282_057|i was lost.
p282_058|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p282_059|my fitness was very poor.
p282_060|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p282_061|it is unique.
p282_062|i expect a rapid response.
p282_064|that's the truth.
p282_065|it seems to have worked.
p282_066|this is the first step.
p282_067|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p282_068|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p282_069|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p282_070|but i've won both ways.
p282_071|sounds like the sixth sense?
p282_072|robin williams is very subdued.
p282_073|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p282_074|it could take some time.
p282_075|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p282_076|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p282_077|it is a job creation scheme.
p282_078|the party is up for it.
p282_079|people must remain vigilant.
p282_080|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p282_081|what has changed?
p282_082|i will miss him.
p282_083|he is in the queue.
p282_084|i first met him last summer.
p282_085|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p282_086|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p282_087|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p282_088|they lived for their children.

p282_097|i love the dome.

p282_114|it's a shame.
p282_115|it was the eighties.
p282_117|tony blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from dublin.
p282_118|the mood is upbeat.
p282_119|it is rubbish.
p282_120|who would be a referee?
p282_121|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p282_122|we enjoyed it today.
p282_123|his son has been travelling with the tartan army for years.

p282_126|i'm so angry.
p282_127|she really suffered for her art.
p282_128|it's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p282_129|it is not a u turn.
p282_130|no production was achieved.
p282_131|i am now unemployed.

p282_148|it is not just about pay.
p282_149|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.

p282_164|i'd love to be like peter.
p282_165|i've put my own money into this project.
p282_166|it has to be now.
p282_167|military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p282_168|i was in the train station overnight.
p282_169|we have a budget in march.
p282_170|we should do everything at a stroke.
p282_171|you had to go and see him.
p282_172|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p282_173|in a way he was.
p282_174|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p282_175|blair's response was weak.
p282_176|as we worked.
p282_177|we are the gateway to justice.
p282_178|i have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p282_179|the goals were good.
p282_180|within months he was a part time tribunal chairman.
p282_181|it's an idea.
p282_182|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p282_183|they need to look after themselves.
p282_184|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p282_185|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p282_186|does this matter?
p282_187|our team is just so young.
p282_188|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p282_189|however he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p282_190|it caused a lot of upset.
p282_191|but a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p282_192|we speak about the performance.
p282_193|it is a farce.
p282_194|peace was won.
p282_195|it's a fact.
p282_196|i came home by ambulance.
p282_197|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p282_198|is that success?
p282_199|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p282_200|who will pay for this?
p282_201|it's all about money money money.
p282_202|sadly it can't.
p282_203|it was worth a photograph.
p282_204|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p282_205|we have an election in eight days.
p282_206|feel the heat?
p282_207|the proposals are to be debated on monday by city councillors.
p282_208|twaddle is a case in point.
p282_209|it had all been arranged.
p282_210|it s all change at kilmarnock.
p282_211|work has started.
p282_213|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p282_214|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p282_215|naturally enough the letter in question was an e.
p282_216|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p282_217|then another one came.
p282_218|the loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p282_219|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p282_220|clearly the stakes are high.
p282_221|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p282_222|i'd never seen a play about me.
p282_223|it's not before time.
p282_224|i didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p282_225|i am very sorry that alastair campbell has taken this decision.
p282_226|i would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p282_227|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p282_228|my wife and family are the support system.
p282_229|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p282_230|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p282_231|we are so proud.
p282_232|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p282_233|of course i was tempted.
p282_234|it's quite a line up
p282_235|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p282_236|the minister is the engineer.
p282_237|i was ready to shoot the day i read the screenplay.
p282_238|it is hard won.
p282_239|our policy is clear.
p282_240|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p282_241|the scene is about this?
p282_242|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p282_243|my son was too young to die.
p282_244|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p282_245|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p282_246|it was a hit.
p282_247|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p282_248|that could be in place by next year.
p282_249|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p282_250|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p282_251|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p282_252|they fail to engage.
p282_253|it will now relate to all public bodies in scotland.
p282_254|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p282_255|they must play for each other.
p282_256|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p282_257|there's not much money in cycling.
p282_258|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p282_259|george w bush the us president condemned the attacks.
p282_260|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p282_261|he has not created a festival resource.
p282_262|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p282_263|he was also married with two children.
p282_264|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p282_265|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p282_266|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p282_267|one knows the feeling.
p282_268|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p282_269|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p282_270|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p282_271|she failed in her action.
p282_272|he promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p282_273|she looked so young.
p282_274|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p282_275|it's so awful.
p282_276|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p282_277|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p282_278|you've got to have both sides.
p282_279|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p282_280|dialogue is the key.
p282_281|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p282_282|she is an expert on medical ethics.
p282_283|who will perform?
p282_284|this is a national crisis.
p282_285|who did the recruiting?
p282_286|she is really magic.
p282_287|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p282_288|i was the sheep.
p282_289|i was brought up in a mining background.
p282_290|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p282_291|nothing is safe.
p282_292|but it's a subtle process.
p282_293|one was a lawyer.
p282_294|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p282_295|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p282_296|they are wrong.
p282_297|eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p282_298|there were no passengers on board.
p282_299|it could work.
p282_300|this is a war over our home.
p282_301|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p282_302|there's no evidence he was ever there.
p282_303|you should be.
p282_304|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p282_305|the letters are going out today.
p282_306|is there on his hands?
p282_307|the premier league has been a huge success.
p282_308|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p282_309|she is very distinctive.
p282_310|we have got to get the points from this one.
p282_311|you may have a short memory.
p282_312|henman has been warned.
p282_313|we are in the end game.
p282_314|it will work.
p282_315|i came into this world with nothing.
p282_316|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p282_317|our message was inclusive.
p282_318|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p282_319|feel the air the space.
p282_320|is there a new way forward?
p282_321|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p282_322|the figures are bad but not that bad.
p282_323|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p282_324|however they will only be found in the wild.
p282_325|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p282_326|three years ago he would have been.
p282_327|that's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p282_328|locally too the mp is under fire.
p282_329|two people were interviewed.
p282_330|i've got no secret.
p282_331|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p282_332|this is a friendly match?
p282_333|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p282_334|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p282_335|they should take their mobile phones.
p282_336|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p282_337|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p282_338|another case of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in scotland yesterday.
p282_339|she is free.
p282_340|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p282_341|tyson is overwhelmed.
p282_342|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p282_343|yet he left a few days later.
p282_344|it was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p282_345|as indeed they would be.
p282_346|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p282_347|instead he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p282_348|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p282_349|the shareholders will vote to wind up the company on friday morning.
p282_350|that would help.
p282_351|my husband was angry.
p282_352|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p282_353|and he laughs.
p282_354|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p282_355|this is a club on the rise.
p282_356|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p282_357|their time has gone.
p282_358|he could make it.
p282_359|the death rates are still as high.
p282_360|now though he has an incentive.
p282_361|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p282_362|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p282_363|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p282_364|it is a simple equation.
p282_365|by that time however it was already too late.
p282_366|it was a funny game.
p282_367|there wasn't a goal.
p282_368|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p282_369|colour was at the core of his life.
p282_370|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p283_001|please call stella.
p283_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p283_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p283_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p283_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p283_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p283_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p283_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p283_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p283_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p283_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p283_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p283_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p283_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p283_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p283_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p283_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p283_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p283_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p283_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p283_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p283_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p283_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p283_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p283_025|that will be a decision for bbc scotland.
p283_026|we are a service industry.
p283_027|it's not going to work out that way.
p283_028|the idea is not new.
p283_029|because we do not need it.
p283_030|and we have a singer.
p283_031|last night mr robertson said he was delighted.
p283_032|we speak about the performance.
p283_033|it's really no great surprise because the price difference is so much.
p283_034|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p283_035|it could well be the case.
p283_036|it is not for any other purpose.
p283_037|that means an extra two years.
p283_038|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p283_039|he is believed to live in britain.
p283_040|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p283_041|she hopes to study in britain one day.
p283_042|the boy is no longer with us.
p283_043|there's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p283_044|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p283_045|among them are many criminals.
p283_046|i was released after six days.
p283_047|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p283_048|every aspect of our play was first class.
p283_049|no details of the talks were given.
p283_050|clearly they had other problems.
p283_051|it also opened a branch in livingston.
p283_052|i would say the position is open.
p283_053|that was the theory anyway.
p283_054|i had come back from london.
p283_055|i was inspired by two things.
p283_056|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p283_057|there was no safety net.
p283_058|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p283_059|how are you sir ?
p283_060|so is that it then ?
p283_061|do i have a favourite ?
p283_062|what do we do ?
p283_063|he also presented you bet
p283_064|inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p283_065|i expect a rapid response.
p283_066|we felt it was sufficient.
p283_067|this is the year of the tiger.
p283_068|the motive for the shooting was not known.
p283_069|we believe a third party was involved.
p283_070|the government should be ashamed.
p283_071|there's still plenty time left.
p283_072|you do not change overnight.
p283_073|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p283_074|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p283_075|we will pay their bills.
p283_076|he is a young man with a new deal.
p283_077|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p283_078|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p283_079|it is very special for me.
p283_080|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p283_081|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p283_082|we should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p283_083|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p283_084|halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p283_085|the result is a vacuum.
p283_086|it looks like a hit.
p283_087|i'd like to see the business case.
p283_088|it makes for an interesting conference.
p283_089|i've had it for the exams.
p283_090|you have to respect the office.
p283_091|he has been a success this year.
p283_092|by then he was walking on water.
p283_093|we have to offer value for money.
p283_094|it's so hard to shift.
p283_095|they lived for their children.
p283_096|potions said he would drive.
p283_097|the trick is to try it.
p283_098|little is known about them.
p283_099|however it did not end that way.
p283_100|it really was an unusual award.
p283_101|it has been the year of the youngster at kilmarnock.
p283_102|the outsourcing deal will take effect in september.
p283_103|we could not get any possession.
p283_104|that is the important thing.
p283_105|why do it otherwise ?
p283_106|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p283_107|so did she meet him ?
p283_108|so what is the campaign about ?
p283_109|and does it ?
p283_110|however a decision should be made before the end of august.
p283_111|it's good to have a voice.
p283_112|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p283_113|there is a contract in existence for allan.
p283_114|their attitude is all wrong.
p283_115|we made a world record together.
p283_116|a year ago she was just a junior minister at the treasury.
p283_117|it's for that reason he should resign.
p283_118|there were no grounds for his action.
p283_119|it's been a long wait.
p283_120|there is no credible official announcement.
p283_121|our house was very small.
p283_122|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p283_123|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p283_124|our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p283_125|sport is good for you.
p283_126|it was won on the issue of the land.
p283_127|i am a committed european.
p283_128|from it emerged a cup.

p283_324|what form did that take ?
p283_326|what are they for ?
p283_327|is there a waiting list ?

p283_346|the party lasted all night.
p283_347|but i think it's different from the rest
p283_348|it is a matter of clarity.
p283_349|he did that every night i was with him.
p283_350|they come to enjoy themselves.
p283_351|urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p283_352|another reason is a shortage of stock.
p283_353|and he goes with it.

p283_372|ferguson is a good example.
p283_373|but they have taken the lesson to heart.
p283_374|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p283_375|my mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p283_376|it should be a great game though.
p283_377|i said she was very young.
p283_378|he had no previous convictions.
p283_379|he was then replaced by ross.
p283_380|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p283_381|had this been common practice ?
p283_382|what do they want us to do ?
p283_383|is it worth it ?
p283_384|does it matter ?
p283_385|that can be good for us.
p283_386|i believe the gap is nearly there.
p283_387|but the main issue will be the sale of burger king.
p283_388|they were to blame for the first two goals.
p283_389|scrutiny by the european parliament is limited.

p283_395|he has an equity stake in the investment house.
p283_396|this is a club on the rise.
p283_397|we came across the first set of bodies.
p283_398|theatre is not a museum.
p283_399|it has only been rumours.
p283_400|final proposals will be published in february.
p283_401|i could not live with it.
p283_402|the death rates are still as high.
p283_403|a review is under way.
p283_404|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p283_405|there is a lack of logic.
p283_406|that investment has now been secured.
p283_407|i tried to be cautious but it's hard in that role.
p283_408|it proved a good decision.
p283_409|colour was at the core of his life.
p283_410|the bbc was a disgrace.
p283_411|thankfully peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p283_412|but the foundations have been laid.

p283_414|i was shaking on the blocks.
p283_415|they've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p283_416|i remain a buyer of the shares.
p283_417|the second goal was superb.
p283_418|that's all i can say.
p283_419|how do you take them away ?
p283_420|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p283_421|after the match do you ?
p283_422|i am astonished at attack.
p283_423|i was pleased with my own game.
p283_424|even if they come out playing a physical game we can cope.
p283_425|yet the data is compelling.
p283_426|no date has been set for a meeting.
p283_427|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p283_428|that is a personal matter.
p283_429|i'm pleased about one thing.
p283_430|my aim is a top six finish.
p283_431|these guys are looking for business.
p283_432|he is on the wrong side.
p283_433|i would rather look at him.
p283_434|it needs to be volatile.
p283_435|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p283_436|it is based on a true story.
p283_437|but in fact the reverse is true.
p283_438|being with me is an honour.
p283_439|he will be judged by his actions.
p283_440|which may be the same thing.
p283_441|we know about the crisis in cattle.
p283_442|we shall not forget him.
p283_443|i can almost pretend to be scottish.
p283_444|everything in golf is a balance.
p283_445|the boy in the sixth sense is not alone.
p283_446|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p283_447|something has got to give.
p283_448|sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p283_449|if we were offered the scotsman i would buy it.
p283_450|we went straight into the bedroom.
p283_451|i do not see it as some kind of reward.
p283_452|but we have built a platform for next season.
p283_453|i was embarrassed by it.
p283_454|that should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p283_455|they had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p283_456|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p283_457|i'd never run for them.
p283_458|she came to the highland show.
p283_459|he was confronted by police.
p283_460|i am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p283_461|she has reached the top of her profession.
p283_462|let that be their memorial.
p283_463|this morning i got a call from my wife.
p283_464|she has now been registered as disabled.
p283_465|the move is considered a major breakthrough.
p283_466|the edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p283_467|it all began as an accident.
p283_468|we are going through the process.
p283_469|ms jackson was not present to put her case.
p283_470|city sentiment is in his favour.
p283_471|it's been a long long journey.
p284_001|please call stella.
p284_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p284_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p284_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p284_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p284_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p284_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p284_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p284_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p284_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p284_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p284_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p284_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p284_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p284_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p284_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p284_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p284_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p284_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p284_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p284_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p284_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p284_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p284_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.it's nice to hear.
p284_025|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p284_026|we will be homeless.
p284_027|is this accurate?
p284_028|i am not interested in the money it is the principle.
p284_029|they have no history.
p284_030|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p284_031|i'd just like to play.
p284_032|there's a story too.
p284_033|this is the window.
p284_034|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p284_035|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p284_036|then suddenly they weren't.
p284_037|it's a fact.
p284_038|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p284_039|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p284_040|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p284_041|dancing was her life.
p284_042|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p284_043|we will push.
p284_044|the shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p284_045|among them are many criminals.
p284_046|it is marvellous.
p284_047|every aspect of our play was first class.
p284_048|our people are ready.
p284_049|here's a clue.
p284_050|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p284_051|i was inspired by two things.
p284_052|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p284_053|my fitness was very poor.
p284_054|sadly it can't.
p284_055|he has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p284_056|i expect a rapid response.
p284_057|what was the main difference?
p284_058|there's a danger.
p284_059|we need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p284_060|lancashire police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p284_061|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p284_062|it's that kind of place.
p284_063|they are real.
p284_064|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p284_065|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p284_066|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p284_067|that was a gold medal for certain.
p284_068|we should have known.
p284_069|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p284_070|robin williams is very subdued.
p284_071|he was at home with his pals.
p284_072|it was magic.

p284_240|it was a kind of contempt.
p284_241|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p284_242|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p284_243|i should think so too.
p284_244|it was a hit.
p284_245|there's the mix.
p284_246|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p284_247|is there on his hands?
p284_248|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.

p284_298|mark fisher was a guest of the northern ireland tourist board.
p284_299|i was the sheep.
p284_300|what has altered?
p284_301|nothing is safe.
p284_302|one was a lawyer.
p284_303|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p284_304|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p284_305|they are wrong.
p284_306|i can live with it.
p284_307|work has started.

p284_320|such actions are rarely popular.
p284_321|we have got to get the points from this one.
p284_322|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p284_323|henman has been warned.
p284_324|i would love it.
p284_325|mr blair is the problem in scotland not the solution.
p284_326|the problems began a long time ago.
p284_327|for the moment our position remains the same.
p284_328|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p284_329|we are in the end game.
p284_330|they will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p284_331|there was no time scale.
p284_332|but no such amendment has been brought before the scottish parliament.
p284_333|it is a job creation scheme.

p284_344|two people were interviewed.
p284_345|i've got no secret.
p284_346|this is a big advantage.
p284_347|i'm very lucky.
p284_348|a great deal has been achieved.
p284_349|yet for my money he was not the man of the match.
p284_350|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p284_351|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p284_352|they should take their mobile phones.

p284_364|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p284_365|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.

p284_367|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p284_368|there was a substantial explosion.
p284_369|their time has gone.
p284_370|all the investment is possible through the public sector.
p284_371|they believed it worked.
p284_372|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p284_373|the final decision was between scotland and the republic of ireland.
p284_374|now though he has an incentive.
p284_375|they have not done so this season so far.
p284_376|it is a simple equation.
p284_377|clark is back on top form.
p284_378|there is no signature.
p284_379|the task is enormous.
p284_380|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p284_381|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p284_382|it is hard to understand.
p284_383|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p284_384|i was lost.
p284_385|something is wrong.
p284_386|the award to senator mitchell was announced by the foreign office.
p284_387|that's the name of the game though.
p284_388|it's like a car crash.
p284_389|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p284_390|building an underground for example has proved a nightmare.
p284_391|you had to go and see him.
p284_392|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p284_393|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p284_394|he also insisted that no concessions had been made to the french.
p284_395|we try to keep it right.
p284_396|stewart will travel with some confidence.
p284_397|here again they were denied a voice.
p284_398|it can help.
p284_399|i love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p284_400|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p284_401|he repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p284_402|but we are a young side.
p284_403|by then a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p284_404|so in a sense it was a government subsidy.
p284_405|it will take place in july.
p284_406|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p284_407|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p284_408|it is full scale.
p284_409|then he laughs.
p284_410|you know the sort of thing.
p284_411|i knew the script.
p284_412|it might be.
p284_413|feel the air the space.
p284_414|he scored a touchdown.
p284_415|i believe the gap is nearly there.
p284_416|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p284_417|the shareholders will vote to wind up the company on friday morning.
p284_418|it is legally binding.
p284_419|is there any prospect of this happening?
p284_420|he was convicted at glasgow sheriff court.
p284_421|eriksson would have approved.
p284_422|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p284_423|it was little else.
p284_424|he is to appeal.
p284_425|nato will prevail.
p285_001|please call stella.
p285_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p285_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p285_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p285_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p285_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p285_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p285_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p285_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p285_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p285_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p285_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p285_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p285_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p285_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p285_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p285_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p285_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p285_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p285_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p285_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p285_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p285_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p285_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p285_025|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p285_026|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p285_027|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p285_028|however the following year the cancer returned.
p285_029|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p285_030|they were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p285_031|there's a story too.
p285_032|this is the window.
p285_033|he was jailed for five years.
p285_034|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p285_035|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p285_036|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p285_037|they're just different.
p285_038|it was clear.
p285_039|indeed he does.
p285_040|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p285_041|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p285_042|sure it's funny.
p285_043|this represents a tough game for us.
p285_044|is a drug dealer?
p285_045|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p285_046|he looks like an afghan.
p285_047|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p285_048|here's a clue.
p285_049|i was lost.
p285_050|it's a miracle.
p285_051|i love the dome.
p285_052|there was no safety net.
p285_053|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p285_054|that's the truth.
p285_055|we will treat it like a world cup match.
p285_056|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p285_057|scotland had great assets.
p285_058|it's that kind of place.
p285_059|they are real.
p285_060|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p285_061|we should have known.
p285_062|i was conceived in aberdeen.
p285_063|robin williams is very subdued.
p285_064|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p285_065|there could be a way back.
p285_066|the death rates are still as high.
p285_067|i had my suspicions.
p285_068|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p285_069|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p285_070|even the one she loved.
p285_071|it's now down in black and white.
p285_072|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p285_073|what has changed?
p285_074|of course we will need to strengthen the squad for europe.
p285_075|he is in the queue.
p285_076|he is driven.
p285_077|all options are open.
p285_078|i was too young.
p285_079|someone who cares
p285_080|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p285_081|it is a blow.
p285_082|they lived for their children.
p285_083|it will be tight.
p285_084|this is the start of our season.
p285_085|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p285_086|that deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p285_087|we knew they could do it.
p285_088|but i was wrong.
p285_089|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p285_090|i wish i had put on a brighter tie.
p285_091|i saw the whole thing.
p285_092|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p285_093|it was mayhem.
p285_094|journalists should make him.
p285_095|it is a love affair.
p285_096|however the intensive care unit at the southern general hospital was full.
p285_097|they tried to deny it.
p285_098|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p285_099|no the equipment is extra.
p285_100|we have an election in eight days.
p285_101|oil embargo endorsed.
p285_102|for these people the ruling is very welcome.
p285_103|she reflects a bit.
p285_104|it was an interesting thing to do.
p285_105|while they went on holiday we got the contract.
p285_106|she is believed to be in south africa.
p285_107|i was fighting for my life i thought.
p285_108|is that right?
p285_109|he leaves a wife a son and a daughter.
p285_110|it was the eighties.
p285_111|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p285_112|it is so sad.
p285_113|tony blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from dublin.
p285_114|in the current outbreak the reverse is true.
p285_115|it is rubbish.
p285_116|who would be a referee?
p285_117|we enjoyed it today.
p285_118|she does not want to speak.
p285_119|here again they were denied a voice.
p285_120|there were no grounds for his action.
p285_121|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p285_122|she really suffered for her art.
p285_123|it is not a u turn.
p285_124|offered the gold medal he declined.
p285_125|no production was achieved.
p285_126|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p285_127|i am now unemployed.
p285_128|we work well together.
p285_129|it's not true.
p285_130|police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p285_131|nobody will know the feeling of the branches until october.
p285_132|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p285_133|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p285_134|if people are genuine then the problem is not osama bin laden.
p285_135|it seems so long since i did the exams.
p285_136|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p285_137|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p285_138|who would be right?
p285_139|alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p285_140|i was awful.
p285_141|that group reported just before christmas.
p285_142|initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p285_143|it s all change at kilmarnock.
p285_144|the amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p285_145|the woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p285_146|the weather forecast isn't good.
p285_147|crucially though united were still alive.
p285_148|i was on a roll.
p285_149|she had gone to the catholic school.
p285_150|we are on a four year mission.
p285_151|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p285_152|it was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p285_153|my dad is a hero.
p285_154|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p285_155|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p285_156|that includes the equipment?
p285_157|well he should know.
p285_158|i will tell you.
p285_159|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p285_160|military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p285_161|as indeed they would be.
p285_162|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p285_163|local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p285_164|they are not advertised.
p285_165|tell it like it was?
p285_166|seven people were later detained by police.
p285_167|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p285_168|by then however both men were already in the us.
p285_169|i carried on for him.
p285_170|he was a crazy man.
p285_171|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p285_172|one season they might do well.
p285_173|as we worked.
p285_174|however the figures were disputed by the scottish prison service.
p285_175|it is not either national standards or local control.
p285_176|my players are special.
p285_177|i drove the ball well.
p285_178|the conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p285_179|the goals were good.
p285_180|his name was unknown.
p285_181|nothing is safe.
p285_182|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p285_183|many innocent people will die.
p285_184|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p285_185|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p285_186|the judges will give a ruling next wednesday.
p285_187|what has caused the demise of singing?
p285_188|any change would be subject to the scottish parliament's approval.
p285_189|there is no openness.
p285_190|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p285_191|treasury spokesman malcolm bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p285_192|it caused a lot of upset.
p285_193|i think the commission has been very very slow to react.
p285_194|it's a fact.
p285_195|i came home by ambulance.
p285_196|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p285_197|we live by the rule of law.
p285_198|the service from the other players was super.
p285_199|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p285_200|they've got three quarters of the way.
p285_201|today was first class.
p285_202|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p285_203|i don't want to use it.
p285_204|there was an e mail.
p285_205|he knows a lot.
p285_206|twaddle is a case in point.
p285_207|it's not before time.
p285_208|it's not ideal.
p285_209|we want to keep the pound.
p285_210|in each case they were a goal down.
p285_211|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p285_212|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p285_213|the council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p285_214|people should make their own decisions.
p285_215|the prime minister has a huge regard for mo.
p285_216|because they didn't want to know.
p285_217|that has been the easy part.
p285_218|he also insisted that no concessions had been made to the french.
p285_219|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p285_220|if it doesn't it doesn't.
p285_221|i am not ready for lennox lewis.
p285_222|clearly the stakes are high.
p285_223|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p285_224|he said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p285_225|but she was.
p285_226|at the time he was a living legend.
p285_227|my wife and family are the support system.
p285_228|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p285_229|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p285_230|they tried to give her advice.
p285_231|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p285_232|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p285_233|wealth is relative.
p285_234|you should be.
p285_235|it's quite nice.
p285_236|three weeks later he resigned.
p285_237|it is not an option but a policy requirement.
p285_238|the home office would not release any further details about the group.
p285_239|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p285_240|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p285_241|if we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
p285_242|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p285_243|i was at the british olympic medical centre on friday.
p285_244|i was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p285_245|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p285_246|we will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p285_247|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p285_248|it was a hit.
p285_249|there's the mix.
p285_250|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p285_251|the concerns are the same.
p285_252|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p285_253|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p285_254|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p285_255|it will now relate to all public bodies in scotland.
p285_256|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p285_257|is that a serious question?
p285_258|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p285_259|however the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p285_260|there's not much money in cycling.
p285_261|souter will be back.
p285_262|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p285_263|perhaps it's because i haven't finished the first two races.
p285_264|he was also married with two children.
p285_265|the system can work.
p285_266|we are happy.
p285_267|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p285_268|we're in shock.
p285_269|of course i was tempted.
p285_270|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p285_271|it was very fast.
p285_272|he promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p285_273|they seem to get away with it.
p285_274|i feel pretty good.
p285_275|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p285_276|she looked so young.
p285_277|it's so awful.
p285_278|he looked very sharp.
p285_279|surely the scottish parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p285_280|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p285_281|he will address the nation this evening.
p285_282|yet it worked.
p285_283|who will perform?
p285_284|it was good.
p285_285|who did the recruiting?
p285_286|we are not going to forget.
p285_287|no briton has ever won.
p285_288|he added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p285_289|who can predict?
p285_290|there was a vacuum.
p285_291|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p285_292|he was at home with his pals.
p285_293|what has altered?
p285_294|i was brought up in a mining background.
p285_295|she is really magic.
p285_296|within months he was a part time tribunal chairman.
p285_297|one was a lawyer.
p285_298|a police inquiry began about two weeks before the general election.
p285_299|they are wrong.
p285_300|it could work.
p285_301|this is a war over our home.
p285_302|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p285_303|alex smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p285_304|it needs a team approach.
p285_305|the report will go before the scottish parliament probably in early autumn.
p285_306|there is no excuse.
p285_307|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p285_308|the letters are going out today.
p285_309|she is very distinctive.
p285_310|we are a peaceful people.
p285_311|hartley should know.
p285_312|henman has been warned.
p285_313|cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the balkans.
p285_314|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p285_315|a review is under way.
p285_316|it will work.
p285_317|i came into this world with nothing.
p285_318|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p285_319|off with their heads.
p285_320|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p285_321|there was no time scale.
p285_322|our message was inclusive.
p285_323|either team will be hard.
p285_324|it's not long enough.
p285_325|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p285_326|he scored a touchdown.
p285_327|the party is up for it.
p285_328|the outcome is not in doubt.
p285_329|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p285_330|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p285_331|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p285_332|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p285_333|three years ago he would have been.
p285_334|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p285_335|locally too the mp is under fire.
p285_336|i've got no secret.
p285_337|went on sale.
p285_338|i'm very lucky.
p285_339|our policy is clear.
p285_340|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p285_341|i will miss him.
p285_342|they should take their mobile phones.
p285_343|i got a yellow card.
p285_344|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p285_345|the man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p285_346|i have a dream.
p285_347|there may be reasons for it.
p285_348|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p285_349|rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p285_350|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p285_351|the scottish parliament should set an example for westminster to follow.
p285_352|the pair are very much in love.
p285_353|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p285_354|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p285_355|we will be homeless.
p285_356|in fact we were all over the shop.
p285_357|it is a memorial.
p285_358|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p285_359|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p285_360|this is a club on the rise.
p285_361|all the investment is possible through the public sector.
p285_362|they believed it worked.
p285_363|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p285_364|the final decision was between scotland and the republic of ireland.
p285_365|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p285_366|it seems a long time ago.
p285_367|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p285_368|so there we won.
p285_369|by that time however it was already too late.
p285_370|there is no signature.
p285_371|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p285_372|it does not even have a staff shortage.
p285_373|however the players should have a voice in these matters.
p285_374|i'm still an amateur in that sense.
p285_375|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p285_376|something is wrong.
p285_377|it will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
p285_378|you can cope with it.
p285_379|building an underground for example has proved a nightmare.
p285_380|at the last i found a bunker.
p285_381|it is the old story.
p285_382|yet the data is compelling.
p285_383|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p285_384|it's just outrageous.
p285_385|they deserved the win.
p285_386|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p285_387|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p285_388|stewart will travel with some confidence.
p285_389|well it did last time he was reminded.
p285_390|i love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p285_391|they are good.
p285_392|he repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p285_393|but we are a young side.
p285_394|by then a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p285_395|it will take place in july.
p285_396|what happened in the summer?
p285_397|the jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p285_398|thankfully no one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p285_399|is that possible?
p285_400|but in fact the reverse is true.
p285_401|what was the difference between them?
p285_402|the orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p285_403|emotions were complex.
p286_001|please call stella.
p286_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p286_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p286_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p286_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p286_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p286_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p286_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p286_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p286_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p286_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p286_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p286_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p286_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p286_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p286_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p286_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p286_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p286_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p286_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p286_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p286_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p286_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p286_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p286_025|smoking is also very important.
p286_026|we must convince the citizens.
p286_027|i am pretty careful with money.
p286_028|because we do not need it.
p286_029|it is about control of our economy.
p286_030|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p286_031|she is employed on short term contracts.
p286_032|they have now been banned from celtic park for life.
p286_033|i feel so desperately sorry for gordon and sarah.
p286_034|clark was desperate to return to the house of commons.
p286_035|mr darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p286_036|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p286_037|costs have got to be controlled.
p286_038|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p286_039|the staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p286_040|it is serious but not that serious.
p286_041|among them are many criminals.
p286_042|he looks like an afghan.
p286_043|he will need that machine.
p286_044|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p286_045|i had come back from london.
p286_046|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p286_047|i had trouble with the producers.
p286_048|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p286_049|we are certainly talking about many millions.
p286_050|we are a new department.
p286_051|he also presented you bet
p286_052|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p286_053|how are you sir ?
p286_054|so is that it then ?
p286_055|do i have a favourite ?
p286_056|people come to see the highlands.
p286_057|the outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p286_058|we have not given up hope.

p287_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p287_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p287_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p287_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p287_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p287_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p287_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p287_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p287_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p287_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p287_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p287_025|a shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p287_026|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p287_027|meetings will also remain private.
p287_028|on our numbers the price is in line with the asset value.
p287_029|he has the courage of the unaware.
p287_030|life was like a timetable.
p287_031|this is a central issue.
p287_032|but a solution has been found.
p287_033|i thought it was an accident.
p287_034|president bush is at war.
p287_035|that period was a struggle.
p287_036|this represents a tough game for us.
p287_037|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p287_038|among them are many criminals.
p287_039|but it might have done.
p287_040|there is no reason at all.
p287_041|this will get their attention.
p287_042|must be prepared to use it.
p287_043|he will need that machine.
p287_044|i had come back from london.
p287_045|i saw them last week.
p287_046|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p287_047|there was no safety net.
p287_048|the teacher would have approved.
p287_049|it is quite a figure.
p287_050|we have to look beyond the very short term.
p287_051|it depends on the couple.
p287_052|i expect a rapid response.
p287_053|the motive for the shooting was not known.
p287_054|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p287_055|you do not change overnight.
p287_056|we will pay their bills.
p287_057|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p287_058|how are you sir ?
p287_059|so is that it then ?
p287_060|do i have a favourite ?
p287_061|what do we do ?
p287_062|it has been an amazing day.
p287_063|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p287_064|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p287_065|this is a big step up.
p287_066|there can be no compromise on welfare.
p287_067|both sides have been hit by injury.
p287_068|now the plot is perfect.
p287_069|that would be too easy.
p287_070|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p287_071|it looks like a hit.
p287_072|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p287_073|i first met him last summer.
p287_074|we did it for the jersey.
p287_075|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p287_076|by then he was walking on water.
p287_077|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p287_078|the cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p287_079|that was a great performance by the team.
p287_080|it was a total disaster.
p287_081|i've never seen anything like it.
p287_082|he added that he felt undermined.
p287_083|it was not an insult.
p287_084|in each case they were a goal down.
p287_085|it was clear on thursday.
p287_086|we would hope to make progress on that next year.
p287_087|for once you should believe the hype.
p287_088|but i know the course.
p287_089|we intend to change the model.
p287_090|two of the team became ill.
p287_091|no the equipment is extra.
p287_092|this decision is a farce.
p287_093|before the game we went for a pint.
p287_094|the cause of the fire is not yet known.
p287_095|it would be the end of farming.
p287_096|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p287_097|it's not a lack of confidence.
p287_098|we have got a race.
p287_099|he will go on the bench.
p287_100|you had better believe it.
p287_101|new year will be very busy.
p287_102|there's still plenty time left.
p287_103|that was the first step.
p287_104|i was impressed with them.
p287_105|such actions are rarely popular.
p287_106|mr blair should be warned.
p287_107|why do it otherwise ?
p287_108|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p287_109|so did she meet him ?
p287_110|so what is the campaign about ?
p287_111|and does it ?
p287_112|then again we could have.
p287_113|there were no grounds for his action.
p287_114|we have a training class.
p287_115|wednesday night was a difficult time for britton.
p287_116|we did what we had to do.
p287_117|they made such decisions in london.
p287_118|she was also very brave.
p287_119|but he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p287_120|you are a gambling man.
p287_121|my conscience is not clear.
p287_122|he is a great addition to our team.
p287_123|i felt he was excellent.
p287_124|we will try to find someone.
p287_125|the money needs to go to the front line.
p287_126|the deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p287_127|i miss the freedom that i had.
p287_128|but the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p287_129|we had to add value.
p287_130|their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p287_131|details will be published in the herald in the coming weeks.
p287_132|that is the real test.
p287_133|i would relish the prospect.
p287_134|it has become a way of life.
p287_135|we will provide immediate access.
p287_136|it will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
p287_137|three hours later the man was free.
p287_138|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p287_139|crucially though united were still alive.
p287_140|charles gordon leader of glasgow city council declined to comment.
p287_141|she had gone to the catholic school.
p287_142|it would seem a natural progression.
p287_143|we will turn the corner.
p287_144|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p287_145|this action reflects a slump in bookings.
p287_146|the strong pound also took its toll.
p287_147|these days are long gone.
p287_148|i am a good player.
p287_149|that shows the strength of the us tour.
p287_150|we have a budget in march.
p287_151|the pension levels will remain the same.
p287_152|you had to go and see him.
p287_153|they could not match it.
p287_154|the people are the hero.
p287_155|do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p287_156|the latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p287_157|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p287_158|this much i can tell you.
p287_159|the hibs manager is no fool.
p287_160|phase one was a shambles.
p287_161|the hotel was now for sale.
p287_162|at the top level the salaries are far too high.
p287_163|tomorrow is a new day.
p287_164|what happened in that game ?
p287_165|are you going to win ?
p287_166|was it the wife ?
p287_167|why change it ?
p287_168|what do we want to do that for ?
p287_169|his son is a local legend.
p287_170|i am not ready to walk away.
p287_171|says the duke of york.
p287_172|equally he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p287_173|our destiny is in our own hands.
p287_174|they bought the property four years ago.
p287_175|they need to look after themselves.
p287_176|he is believed to live in britain.
p287_177|people like to talk about these things.
p287_178|being investor ready is a good start.
p287_179|they all made the european ryder cup team.
p287_180|we've had great things in the past.
p287_181|it could be done by experts and lawyers.
p287_182|david sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p287_183|you know the sort of thing.
p287_184|they were seriously after him.
p287_185|however murray johnstone is not on the menu.
p287_186|it was a pre emptive strike.
p287_187|it caused a lot of upset.
p287_188|this year it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p287_189|last night was a key episode.
p287_190|we have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p287_191|it is hard to tell.
p287_192|i can't play the game for them.
p287_193|i was inspired by two things.
p287_194|they might be surprised by the response.
p287_195|it comes from reflection or thinking.
p287_196|this will be our new beginning.
p287_197|the service from the other players was super.
p287_198|however it is not as simple as this.
p287_199|the sanctions are about collective punishment.
p287_200|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p287_201|getting this right is essential.
p287_202|does the name matter ?
p287_203|how do you get it back ?
p287_204|what are you not good at ?
p287_205|i think therefore i am ?
p287_206|who was she ?
p287_207|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p287_208|from there they can go anywhere.
p287_209|i had relied on him.
p287_210|we used to live with dignity in our country.
p287_211|this is a sensible and common sense approach.
p287_212|it had all been arranged.
p287_213|his third goal was superb.
p287_214|it's all change at kilmarnock.
p287_215|his second was a beauty.
p287_216|i have wanted to buy one for the national gallery.
p287_217|i wouldn't even respond to that question.
p287_218|and the world cup has not even begun.
p287_219|he remains a main board director of royal.
p287_220|the red card was okay.
p287_221|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p287_222|women were mostly notable by their absence.
p287_223|it will now take over the running of the estate.
p287_224|the loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p287_225|i am not ready for lennox lewis.
p287_226|murray financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p287_227|so far the problems have occurred in the us.
p287_228|we have learned a tremendous amount.
p287_229|she died in middle age.
p287_230|and thought we would get away with it.
p287_231|we were a load of rubbish.
p287_232|the trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
p287_233|this is a family club.
p287_234|they need to win a trophy.
p287_235|i was ready for this.
p287_236|i am still waiting for a reply.
p287_237|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p287_238|my future is in the marathon.
p287_239|the effects are not all bad.
p287_240|he would not impose a fine.
p287_241|it was a fairy tale.
p287_242|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p287_243|she took them for a term.
p287_244|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p287_245|but that's another story for another day.
p287_246|on a practical level it would be difficult.
p287_247|persuaded to change his mind.
p287_248|either way the investor retains the premium.
p287_249|by then a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p287_250|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p287_251|i should think so too.
p287_252|it makes no difference to their friendship.
p287_253|no production contract is yet in sight.
p287_254|tourism is a vital industry for scotland.
p287_255|that you can do it.
p287_256|he was on a horse.
p287_257|the concerns are the same.
p287_258|we are in a war.
p287_259|it is not enough to be first division champions.
p287_260|we run within the law.
p287_261|on the contrary they stand to gain.
p287_262|they are very keen to work with us.
p287_263|that should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p287_264|it does not work that way in scottish football.
p287_265|they must play for each other.
p287_266|it is also very valuable.
p287_267|there's not much money in cycling.
p287_268|it is a crisis of human rights a crisis of leadership.
p287_269|the morale of the yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p287_270|we're trying to get rounded performers.
p287_271|this is a question of islam.
p287_272|and they were being paid ?
p287_273|was everything done to save people ?
p287_274|what was the matter for concern ?
p287_275|do i think about them often ?
p287_276|is it in the right place ?
p287_277|did he trip ?
p287_278|as for scotland we can just enjoy the moment.
p287_279|internet users will double over the next three years in the uk.
p287_280|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p287_281|it would create a scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p287_282|frankly we should all have such problems.
p287_283|it was an easy decision to come here.
p287_284|and michael was just great.
p287_285|both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p287_286|he ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p287_287|he was dead on arrival at hospital.
p287_288|it was never a free kick.
p287_289|she failed in her action.
p287_290|he is a close friend of gordon brown.
p287_291|we have to be very very careful.
p287_292|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p287_293|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p287_294|if not he should go home.
p287_295|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p287_296|size is not the issue.
p287_297|the orchestra is quite good but the hall is terrible.
p287_298|but it is up again.
p287_299|the rescue package is public money.
p287_300|either team will be hard.
p287_301|that is the general feeling.
p287_302|it has to be an event.
p287_303|clydesdale bank declined to comment.
p287_304|we can work all night.
p287_305|the answer is with ourselves.
p287_306|deputy prime minister john prescott appealed for privacy.
p287_307|there is no evidence for that.
p287_308|i can hardly believe it.
p287_309|nothing has been put into action.
p287_310|you are a different people.
p287_311|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p287_312|this will secure the future of our industry.
p287_313|they are not left wing.
p287_314|mcnaughton was not so sure.
p287_315|i was brought up in a mining background.
p287_316|the city welcomed the numbers.
p287_317|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p287_318|this is a war over our home.
p287_319|we have a good healthy debate.
p287_320|and he goes with it.
p287_321|i have signed a contract.
p287_322|it is a court case.
p287_323|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p287_324|leading share prices have also fallen in paris and frankfurt.
p287_325|however walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p287_326|after some discussion they did.
p287_327|the premier league has been a huge success.
p287_328|it wasn't a good day for us.
p287_329|the show is at an end.
p287_330|what form did that take ?
p287_331|are they free ?
p287_332|what are they for ?
p287_333|is there a waiting list ?
p287_334|do they think anyone else wants them ?
p287_335|so what happens next ?
p287_336|it was an achievement all right.
p287_337|my whole life has changed.
p287_338|we are a peaceful people.
p287_339|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p287_340|you may have a short memory.
p287_341|the problems began a long time ago.
p287_342|a home office spokesman said.
p287_343|in the old days it was easy.
p287_344|i think it's about time.
p287_345|the airport was even different.
p287_346|other people had looked at it.
p287_347|they are now out in the cold.
p287_348|it is not all good news and relief for labour however.
p287_349|it is a strong case.
p287_350|my view has now completely changed.
p287_351|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p287_352|shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p287_353|it's wonderful to have won.
p287_354|he was then replaced by ross.
p287_355|i'd like to take the plunge.
p287_356|appointments should be made on merit.
p287_357|i have a moral dilemma.
p287_358|even the one she loved.
p287_359|this might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p287_360|a few days after making the video i went to the inquiry.
p287_361|they were the acts of men.
p287_362|this should include procedures for personal imports.
p287_363|the idea was first mooted a year ago.
p287_364|three years ago he would have been.
p287_365|he did a good job.
p287_366|it's a policy which has worked for us.
p287_367|look at the liberal democrats.
p287_368|he expected a conclusion by next thursday.
p287_369|it is a stroke of genius.
p287_370|the members have voted against it.
p287_371|we knew he was very creative.
p287_372|but the foreign secretary can cope.
p287_373|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p287_374|they should take their mobile phones.
p287_375|se is well down that road.
p287_376|the hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
p287_377|there is a cup final at stake.
p287_378|it's only a matter of scale.
p287_379|i do not like to lose.
p287_380|there is no deal as yet.
p287_381|it's as wide as a church in here.
p287_382|this remains the party's policy.
p287_383|they will fight for everything.
p287_384|the pair are very much in love.
p287_385|tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p287_386|it was like a vacuum.
p287_387|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p287_388|my dad is all right.
p287_389|it gets into the culture.
p287_390|there was a substantial explosion.
p287_391|but we are very near.
p287_392|finally he paid for the movie.
p287_393|it has only been rumours.
p287_394|he put some colour into scottish history.
p287_395|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p287_396|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p287_397|safety was also an issue.
p287_398|had this been common practice ?
p287_399|what do they want us to do ?
p287_400|is it worth it ?
p287_401|does it matter ?
p287_402|motion described it as a unique event.
p287_403|we have to reinforce the pressure on iraq.
p287_404|no because it was too many.
p287_405|it's too close to call.
p287_406|i tried to be cautious but it's hard in that role.
p287_407|i decided to take my time.
p287_408|first we had the battle of britain.
p287_409|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p287_410|that is the ultimate revenge.
p287_411|it certainly appeared that way.
p287_412|they are looking for profit.
p287_413|i remain a buyer of the shares.
p287_414|you thought it was a headache.
p287_415|i am astonished at attack.
p287_416|this market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p287_417|there is a solution she believes.
p287_418|potions said he would drive.
p287_419|it was important to win the singles.
p287_420|i'm pleased about one thing.
p287_421|that's been all around europe with me.
p287_422|he's had to suffer for the last six years.
p287_423|in time may prove a worthy successor to billy dodds.
p287_424|both promotions come as no surprise.
p288_001|please call stella.
p288_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p288_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p288_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p288_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p288_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p288_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p288_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p288_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p288_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p288_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p288_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p288_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p288_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p288_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p288_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p288_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p288_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p288_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p288_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p288_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p288_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p288_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p288_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p288_025|she is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p288_026|it is a disaster area.
p288_027|is this accurate?
p288_028|however the following year the cancer returned.
p288_029|because we do not need it.
p288_030|i was an athlete.
p288_031|it is a case of taking a risk.
p288_032|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p288_033|i think a move would create a lot of interest.
p288_034|it was fit for royalty.
p288_035|clark was desperate to return to the house of commons.
p288_036|president bush is at war.
p288_037|that brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p288_038|i was scared.
p288_039|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p288_040|but it took a lot of bottle.
p288_041|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p288_042|we need to chat.
p288_043|but it might have done.
p288_044|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p288_045|he is too weak to move.
p288_046|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p288_047|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p288_048|it will come all right.
p288_049|i was lost.
p288_050|i guess i was lucky though.
p288_051|i was inspired by two things.
p288_052|sadly it can't.
p288_053|it's very odd.
p288_054|it is unique.
p288_055|it will take time.
p288_056|that's the truth.
p288_057|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p288_058|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p288_059|four other charges were dropped.
p288_060|lancashire police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p288_061|they're appalled by that.
p288_062|scotland had great assets.
p288_063|equity declined to comment.
p288_064|we should have known.
p288_065|the end result is precisely the same.
p288_066|sounds like the sixth sense?
p288_067|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p288_068|that was the easy election.
p288_069|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p288_070|neither it is.
p288_071|he seemed to lose his focus.
p288_072|it can be halted.
p288_073|it was chaotic.
p288_074|is there a new way forward?
p288_075|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p288_076|i've not thought about it.
p288_077|people must remain vigilant.
p288_078|this is the way things should be handled.
p288_079|every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p288_080|it's all going to clear the debt.
p288_081|last week he was taken into hospital.
p288_082|nothing is yet confirmed.
p288_083|new zealand rugby is totally different.
p288_084|we have other options.
p288_085|when people talk about the beach boys and brian wilson.
p288_086|by then he was walking on water.
p288_087|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p288_088|every time i play i do not understand their reaction.
p288_089|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p288_090|it is a lifeline.
p288_091|that deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p288_092|scotland will have strong defences as part of the united kingdom.
p288_093|they were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p288_094|children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p288_095|journalists should make him.
p288_096|it was a good performance.
p288_097|here again they were denied a voice.
p288_098|i didn't play well last year.
p288_099|it was an adventure.
p288_100|i did not think about the ryder cup.
p288_101|i'm not depressed.
p288_102|he plans to call for an aid package from mr macdonald.
p288_103|it's in his blood.
p288_104|it had been played at festivals.
p288_105|we do not expect any surplus.
p288_106|it is so sad.
p288_107|they were behind the wheel.
p288_108|the fire was above the hole.
p288_109|we are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p288_110|on this showing they should stick with the lads.
p288_111|it would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p288_112|thereafter he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p288_113|it is rubbish.
p288_114|this is the first big idea of the scottish parliament election.
p288_115|an announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p288_116|that's all right then.
p288_117|there were no grounds for his action.
p288_118|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p288_119|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p288_120|i'm so angry.
p288_121|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p288_122|so the european elections are extremely important.
p288_123|the proposals are to be debated on monday by city councillors.
p288_124|well you can have a tree.
p288_125|i had relied on him.
p288_126|you've got to be vigilant.
p288_127|the goals were good.
p288_128|we never said that we would walk through the third division.
p288_129|we are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p288_130|if people are genuine then the problem is not osama bin laden.
p288_131|and the farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p288_132|we will continue to talk to find a solution for scottish football.
p288_133|is that titanic?
p288_134|he felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p288_135|initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p288_136|labour's scottish general secretary alex rowley was delighted yesterday.
p288_137|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p288_138|he should have won.
p288_139|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p288_140|the selection process is still at a very early stage.
p288_141|the weather forecast isn't good.
p288_142|a final decision will be taken by first minister donald dewar.
p288_143|charles gordon leader of glasgow city council declined to comment.
p288_144|that first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p288_145|she also defended the lord chancellor's existing powers.
p288_146|alain baxter did not have long to speak on friday.
p288_147|they were later discharged from hospital.
p288_148|this latter point is hugely important.
p288_149|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p288_150|it was so new so exciting.
p288_151|i'm just enjoying every match.
p288_152|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p288_153|it has to be now.
p288_154|i was in the train station overnight.
p288_155|local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p288_156|we knew we had the goal we wanted.
p288_157|i have got a wife to feed.
p288_158|it is not too late to get on board.
p288_159|they will do their own thing.
p288_160|does that put pressure on us?
p288_161|last weekend in germany he missed the cut.
p288_162|it is too much for me.
p288_163|it is a terrible place.
p288_164|and i was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p288_165|nobody did in those days.
p288_166|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p288_167|he was a crazy man.
p288_168|they thought they had found a home.
p288_169|the jury is still out.
p288_170|it's quite a routine.
p288_171|it should be easy.
p288_172|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p288_173|tony had arrived.
p288_174|mr docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p288_175|there is no point in looking any further.
p288_176|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p288_177|it's a portrait of glasgow not the portrait.
p288_178|mr marshall is expected to join the council of europe.
p288_179|it's a joke.
p288_180|it just came into my head that day.
p288_181|they really did a great job.
p288_182|it is tough but possible.
p288_183|it was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p288_184|people will ask about us.
p288_185|if the director is with you.
p288_186|it's very difficult to find a buyer.
p288_187|we have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p288_188|the spokeswoman said the flat in london was very small.
p288_189|peace was won.
p288_190|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p288_191|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p288_192|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p288_193|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p288_194|the conference is the first test.
p288_195|is that success?
p288_196|but we are not immune to the problem.
p288_197|they are in the euro.
p288_198|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p288_199|but she might be.
p288_200|it's all about money money money.
p288_201|some realism was needed about time resources and management.
p288_202|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p288_203|now it's all right.
p288_204|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p288_205|saddam hussein is a devil.
p288_206|feel the heat?
p288_207|she should not be blamed.
p288_208|twaddle is a case in point.
p288_209|it had all been arranged.
p288_210|the second is the reaction of the hibs fans.
p288_211|in each case they were a goal down.
p288_212|i was so nervous.
p288_213|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p288_214|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p288_215|he said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p288_216|who was on the panel?
p288_217|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p288_218|we've got the bronze.
p288_219|mental health is a massive issue.
p288_220|you have to do your research.
p288_221|we played them off the pitch.
p288_222|but it will be sorted out this week.
p288_223|it was good fun.
p288_224|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p288_225|i'd never seen a play about me.
p288_226|it is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p288_227|the track is currently covered in snow.
p288_228|the body follows the mind.
p288_229|however no further action was taken by police.
p288_230|she hopes to study in britain one day.
p288_231|it is set in paris.
p288_232|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p288_233|i haven't made the donation yet.
p288_234|and a film maker was born.
p288_235|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p288_236|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p288_237|we have a free vote on these things in our party.
p288_238|he's got to go.
p288_239|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p288_240|it's too much work.
p288_241|it would appear that it has not been a problem.
p288_242|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p288_243|it is hard won.
p288_244|jock brown is appointed as general manager.
p288_245|in fact we were all over the shop.
p288_246|he's a lovely young man.
p288_247|a friendship that will endure.
p288_248|he said he was impressed by the set up at celtic.
p288_249|i will not allow the destruction of the scottish fishing industry.
p288_250|scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p288_251|i told you i was ill.
p288_252|it's a source of deep concern.
p288_253|this is a big club.
p288_254|it is very important that we get the balance right.
p288_255|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p288_256|i was happily surprised.
p288_257|the work between the musicians and the fire is very important.

p288_264|the government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p288_265|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p288_266|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p288_267|we do not want any terrorist attacks on any israeli civilians.
p288_268|and michael was just great.
p288_269|it's great because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p288_270|in fact they have the opposite effect.
p288_271|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p288_272|a search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p288_273|he is a close friend of gordon brown.
p288_274|i am an estate agent.
p288_275|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p288_276|it happens from time to time.
p288_277|but i've won both ways.
p288_278|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p288_279|you've got to have both sides.
p288_280|he will address the nation this evening.
p288_281|the attacker died in the crash.
p288_282|maloney is an engaging talent.
p288_283|who will perform?
p288_284|it's like a high school play.
p288_285|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p288_286|this is a national crisis.

p288_291|sunday's game was not a trial.
p288_292|who can predict?
p288_293|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p288_294|the move was welcomed by the roman catholic church in scotland.
p288_295|we have to sort it out ourselves.
p288_296|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p288_297|the home was now under new management.
p288_298|i thought it was my only chance.
p288_299|however the snow was welcomed by some.
p288_300|nothing is safe.
p288_301|one was a lawyer.
p288_302|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p288_303|we believe the world has too many refugees already.
p288_304|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p288_305|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p288_306|it's just not funny
p288_307|i was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p288_308|scotland has shown the way.
p288_309|it's certainly different.
p288_310|o neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p288_311|we want to play at the worlds.
p288_312|he was solid.
p288_313|this is the culture change in medicine.
p288_314|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p288_315|there is no other solution to congestion in edinburgh.
p288_316|i never thought it would take this long.
p288_317|my whole life has changed.
p288_318|they wanted the club to make money.
p288_319|hartley should know.
p288_320|kids are terrible.
p288_321|the home team had an amazing start.
p288_322|my body is clearly capable.
p288_323|for the moment our position remains the same.
p288_324|i had my suspicions.
p288_325|however the groups denied the claims.
p288_326|there was some merit in that.
p288_327|i came into this world with nothing.
p288_328|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p288_329|the figures are bad but not that bad.
p288_330|they also recovered a picture of osama bin laden.
p288_331|we agreed to disagree.
p288_332|he was then replaced by ross.
p288_333|donald was his friend.
p288_334|i'd like to take the plunge.
p288_335|she did not attend the courtroom.
p288_336|finally he paid for the movie.
p288_337|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p288_338|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p288_339|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p288_340|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p288_341|i'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p288_342|these days are long gone.
p288_343|he's been the key to everything.
p288_344|the boat was fantastic.
p288_345|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p288_346|i was pleased to be back on the podium in brazil.
p288_347|it was good for us that they lost that day.
p288_348|a few days after making the video i went to the inquiry.
p288_349|you need a licence to run a pub.
p288_350|that has been lost.
p288_351|a report is the first step in a criminal case in india.
p288_352|that's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p288_353|it's good to start with judith.
p288_354|there is no room for error.
p288_355|the pressure is on celtic in the main.
p288_356|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p288_357|he's very explosive.
p288_358|we have to move forward.
p288_359|but the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p288_360|however it was well worth the wait.
p288_361|our numbers are small.
p288_362|that would help.
p288_363|so i left.
p288_364|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p288_365|it should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p288_366|it was a double tragedy for the family.
p288_367|i am a star.
p288_368|not so it seems.
p288_369|who was the mystery mp?
p288_370|all the investment is possible through the public sector.
p288_371|the play is based on a real life event.
p288_372|now though he has an incentive.
p288_373|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p288_374|it also highlighted some local hero districts.
p288_375|we do not get that impression now.
p288_376|they play together perfectly.
p288_377|it was a funny game.
p288_378|it is a large number.
p288_379|i am a wealthy person.
p288_380|colour was at the core of his life.
p288_381|i know i'm in a very special position.
p288_382|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p288_383|it is an interesting title believing in britain.
p288_384|it's a logical consequence of the formula.
p288_385|he is also keen to win the european order of merit.
p288_386|there is a solution she believes.
p288_387|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p288_388|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p288_389|it's just outrageous.
p288_390|it's like a basketball.
p288_391|stewart will travel with some confidence.
p288_392|he is on the wrong side.
p288_393|it is not normal practice.
p288_394|this is a major step forward for carers.
p288_395|the orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p288_396|my house was shaking at the time.
p288_397|emotions were complex.
p288_398|his remarks appear to have had an effect.
p288_399|he's already made history.
p288_400|then he laughs.
p288_401|you ask the question.
p288_402|that is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
p288_403|what would be the point?
p288_404|i would welcome a proper public discussion on this issue.
p288_405|quality meat scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p288_406|i reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p288_407|the real enemy is in your own back yard.
p288_408|the visual arts committee took this decision in december.
p288_409|we need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p288_410|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p288_411|the shareholders will vote to wind up the company on friday morning.

p292_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p292_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p292_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p292_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p292_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p292_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p292_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p292_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p292_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p292_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p292_025|i was not involved in these discussions.
p292_026|o is he conscious?
p292_027|eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p292_028|they are being deported from their homes.
p292_029|it is the last week of rehearsals.
p292_030|i thought the game was very poor.
p292_031|three days later he was killed.
p292_032|i don't expect to be here tomorrow.
p292_033|or it's not really for us if you like.
p292_034|it was a deceit.
p292_035|you are in power.
p292_036|pr will be just one of them.
p292_037|everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p292_038|it is just like the stock market.
p292_039|and the newspapers were full of it.
p292_040|i wish the solutions were as easy.
p292_041|she does not see anything ever changing.
p292_042|it doesn't come any better than this.
p292_043|mr blair should be warned.
p292_044|the idea has potential for the future.
p292_045|i did not concentrate on my performance.
p292_046|that was not due to me.
p292_047|structural changes were also required.
p292_048|we suffered a lot for seven years.
p292_049|the racist abuse was terrible.
p292_050|what is the new religion?
p292_051|five officers were injured.
p292_052|it was all for good reason as well.
p292_053|fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p292_054|i'm trying not to think about that.
p292_055|ms jackson was not at the meeting.
p292_056|i find the whole affair disturbing.
p292_057|one woman refused to sit down.
p292_058|we're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p292_059|i was completely knackered.
p292_060|there are two interests in this woodland.
p292_061|a killer is also on the loose.
p292_062|last night the row continued.
p292_063|our approach will be different.
p292_064|you can see how he made his money.
p292_065|it's really good as long as we play well.
p292_066|we would certainly consider the proposals.
p292_067|we tend to come good at the end.
p292_068|his record with england was not good.
p292_069|lose and they would be ridiculed.
p292_070|three penalties were given.
p292_071|i didn't think they would be that stupid.
p292_072|he was between people and god.
p292_073|we are just being flooded.
p292_074|we could easily have lost that game.
p292_075|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p292_076|there were no proposals on the table.
p292_077|it is true but it is only part of the issue.
p292_078|there's only one word for it.
p292_079|it was very full anyway.
p292_080|that was him under pressure.
p292_081|i can't believe she is dead.
p292_082|i was in prison for a year.
p292_083|among them is his beloved teacher.
p292_084|he had a really frustrating time last year.
p292_085|i am delighted for everyone in airdrie.
p292_086|i am constantly changing my mind.
p292_087|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p292_088|ending a tenancy is a last resort.
p292_089|but he just carried on anyway.
p292_090|we should be capable of managing it though.
p292_091|it was that kind of afternoon.
p292_092|his presence was very important.
p292_093|we are pursuing legal action against the government.
p292_094|he insisted that his staff were too.
p292_095|they should come clean.
p292_096|let's see that increase over the years.
p292_097|that though is an old story.
p292_098|the real issue is personal.
p292_099|life becomes a song.
p292_100|it's about time something was done about equipment.
p292_101|i've learned from my mistakes.
p292_102|so far this season this approach is working.
p292_103|i have got a knife.
p292_104|it was for me like a week in heaven.
p292_105|what did we learn?
p292_106|on that basis he would set it aside.
p292_107|that however is the end of the good news.
p292_108|seven people were later detained by police.
p292_109|it's nice to be involved.
p292_110|there could still be some to come forward.
p292_111|what are they like?
p292_112|they were back in favour with the sac.
p292_113|the squad is too small.
p292_114|together they will attempt to express the whole.
p292_115|i'm just going to do my best.
p292_116|at the moment the success in germany is good.
p292_117|they offered to make an investment into it.
p292_118|we have no knowledge of this.
p292_119|i was influenced by all of these things.
p292_120|is my wife a racist?
p292_121|this would not be my first choice.
p292_122|it certainly should not be used too often.
p292_123|they will run a mile.
p292_124|why do you want to come to edinburgh?
p292_125|britain has never had it so good.
p292_126|we are under no illusions about this.
p292_127|but the killer remains at large.
p292_128|scotland is an increasing concern for young people.
p292_129|he is adamant that he is innocent.
p292_130|i had a train to catch.
p292_131|it is a terrible loss.
p292_132|what's happening to her?
p292_133|it was even worse than at home.
p292_134|i did not understand the dynamics of scotland.
p292_135|the plane was in flames
p292_136|we cannot lose it.
p292_137|i still think he will win.
p292_138|elections would follow in about two years.
p292_139|however this idea is never developed.
p292_140|i've got to get on with my career.
p292_141|it is a road of death.
p292_142|now we look forward to it.
p292_143|these awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p292_144|we've had an enjoyable adventure.
p292_145|i have a great respect for her.
p292_146|i suggest a new plan.
p292_147|it takes the biscuit.
p292_148|but we are not immune to the problem.
p292_149|you're not going to forget something like that.
p292_150|they missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p292_151|the result is utterly compelling.
p292_152|this is the root of their problems.
p292_153|other forces were however at work.
p292_154|he also has property interests in the country.
p292_155|that takes time and games and practice.
p292_156|if only the acting profession was that simple.
p292_157|it is a new company for scotland.
p292_158|we should have gone solo.
p292_159|we don't even know his name.
p292_160|they have known the hard times.
p292_161|it is about the script for me.
p292_162|you cannot enter the clubhouse.
p292_163|the president will not be removed from office.
p292_164|these are serious matters.
p292_165|are you all right at the front?
p292_166|we want to replicate that success.
p292_167|it was the first time they met.
p292_168|it's been a good year.
p292_169|i was never alone with her right?
p292_170|that will be vital.
p292_171|it's a technical demand.
p292_172|it's just a normal life.
p292_173|i cannot speak on behalf of the ira.
p292_174|this is a very high price.
p292_175|he is the example for all of us.
p292_176|there is no way to do this.
p292_177|clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p292_178|only one person can claim the credit.
p292_179|market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p292_180|o neill has delivered.
p292_181|but there was no going back.
p292_182|we will reform the welfare state.
p292_183|progress is being made but it is slow.
p292_184|we didn't think anything would happen.
p292_185|he had come of age.
p292_186|we were a shambles at the back.
p292_187|it's not before time.
p292_188|one of these problems is the railways.
p292_189|it is a very sad day.
p292_190|a crucial moment has arrived.
p292_191|i have nothing to hide.
p292_192|next time round it will be different.
p292_193|how can they get one?
p292_194|only local people are helping.
p292_195|we had to work hard for it.
p292_196|john lennon is a very large industry.
p292_197|this is my homeland.
p292_198|you saw the pain he was in.
p292_199|asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p292_200|drugs are always an issue.
p292_201|lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p292_202|three weeks later he resigned.
p292_203|it has affected me.
p292_204|she made no further comment.
p292_205|i have no conflict with them.
p292_206|the next one comes up.
p292_207|she was close to suicide at one stage.
p292_208|we've got better players here.
p292_209|there is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p292_210|we are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p292_211|people have no chance of getting out.
p292_212|i am appalled by this news.
p292_213|we were extremely arrogant.
p292_214|obviously we would want to look at this.
p292_215|i was just getting over the time difference.
p292_216|i am proud of moments like that.
p292_217|manager bobby williamson has no injury worries.
p292_218|no one expected that their parents would stay.
p292_219|we're looking for unity in the council.
p292_220|the observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p292_221|you cannot allow it to go on.
p292_222|it's up to the defence team.
p292_223|i'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p292_224|no means testing will be required.
p292_225|he has already received the freedom of aberdeen.
p292_226|i don't think that's very fair.
p292_227|he was on a horse.
p292_228|human beings are always the same.
p292_229|then there's the problem of sympathy.
p292_230|if only he knew himself.
p292_231|this action could have been avoided.
p292_232|i watched a game.
p292_233|anyone else can apply.
p292_234|it was like the old days.
p292_235|this was never a support group.
p292_236|the first time you read a play.
p292_237|i was a little surprised.
p292_238|this is my home town.
p292_239|that was six years ago.
p292_240|nothing can bring back their son.
p292_241|it is up to us to approve it.
p292_242|his musicals were very much of their time.
p292_243|they might well be right.
p292_244|there is great demand for human cloning.
p292_245|the balance isn't there at emi.
p292_246|it starts to get you down.
p292_247|we didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p292_248|my life has been turned upside down.
p292_249|the years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p292_250|i have played well the past two days.
p292_251|i said what was that about?
p292_252|this could prove a problem.
p292_253|he is an excellent defender strong and quick.
p292_254|his game was complete.
p292_255|what does she consider her greatest achievement?
p292_256|this is too much like scotland.
p292_257|he's been here on numerous occasions.
p292_258|that goes back a long way.
p292_259|i wouldn't have had the abandon.
p292_260|they were not at the property yesterday.
p292_261|we will not tolerate it.
p292_262|it should not make the same mistake again.
p292_263|they loved it and it showed.
p292_264|however by then the damage had been done.
p292_265|as far as scotland is concerned he should relax.
p292_266|have we not been here before?
p292_267|just what we didn't need.
p292_268|inquiries are still in an early stage.
p292_269|it is a very beautiful city.
p292_270|she added the sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p292_271|the company reacted very very well.
p292_272|her body was found on monday morning.
p292_273|the issues are very intense.
p292_274|it won't be their last.
p292_275|you've got to have both sides.
p292_276|i'll tell you honestly.
p292_277|dialogue is the key.
p292_278|it has been only average.
p292_279|he should be worried about me.
p292_280|that never happens in real life.
p292_281|i feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p292_282|that was the gimmick.
p292_283|this is a national crisis.
p292_284|he has changed my life forever.
p292_285|again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p292_286|in europe it is always over two games.
p292_287|there's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p292_288|however we had no failures in our side.
p292_289|this is his first movie.
p292_290|he already had had complaints.
p292_291|for that much we must be grateful.
p292_292|spent three months alone at sea.
p292_293|they are the heroes.
p292_294|that will be the key to success.
p292_295|they are in good spirits.
p292_296|three hours later the man was free.
p292_297|you can't get the experience in austria.
p292_298|i wonder if rangers do that?
p292_299|i'm going to miss it.
p292_300|the atmosphere was excellent.
p292_301|however the snow was welcomed by some.
p292_302|as to rugby well no one knows.
p292_303|one was a lawyer.
p292_304|our task is to complete the picture.
p292_305|it may have been a cry for help.
p292_306|his descent was pathetic.
p292_307|by now he was very ill with cancer.
p292_308|but let's not get carried away.
p292_309|it's only tackling congestion.
p292_310|surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p292_311|we've seen that time and time again.
p292_312|friends of the family have given their support.
p292_313|this means a great deal to the families.
p292_314|they said that they stood by their statement.
p292_315|it should be equal.
p292_316|we are on a four year mission.
p292_317|he was always nice to me.
p292_318|is he going to look after them?
p292_319|he had no answer.
p292_320|scotland is too small a country for that.
p292_321|special measures were needed.
p292_322|your father was a good man.
p292_323|you do that because you want to win.
p292_324|the whole family was in shock.
p292_325|this is the last chance and everyone knows it.
p292_326|my whole life has changed.
p292_327|they always seem to produce.
p292_328|he wanted someone young and ambitious.
p292_329|but everywhere the problems are the same.
p292_330|it does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p292_331|the company's in good shape.
p292_332|he became the focus of surrounding interest.
p292_333|it is out there.
p292_334|this country has many challenges.
p292_335|the best option is to destroy the plants.
p292_336|i've never had problems with any football managers.
p292_337|to begin with it looks good.
p292_338|they are with their father.
p292_339|this was a unique election.
p292_340|the review has been conducted fairly.
p292_341|they will run in tandem with new work.
p292_342|i had to win this race.
p292_343|and right now it isn't there.
p292_344|the boat was fantastic.
p292_345|donald was his friend.
p292_346|the overall effect is impressive but distancing.
p292_347|the girls are ready to compete.
p292_348|it gives us something to work on.
p292_349|it was all too little too late.
p292_350|what's the problem with change?
p292_351|our destiny is in our own hands.
p292_352|there are moments of silence.
p292_353|glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p292_354|the board of governors must act.
p292_355|that didn't happen for two reasons.
p292_356|it is time for a new approach.
p292_357|now they have decided to have a rethink.
p292_358|tiger is the exception.
p292_359|there's no choice is there?
p292_360|does it noel?
p292_361|do not forget about monaco.
p292_362|you can't give in to the vandals.
p292_363|glasgow is far from overload.
p292_364|everything was an effort.
p292_365|and does it even matter?
p292_366|my parents are exhausted.
p292_367|like his acting it was an accident.
p292_368|that's why he is a national treasure.
p292_369|i'm delighted for andy.
p292_370|and how he kept his word.
p292_371|it's their duty to protect them.
p292_372|the cup has come home.
p292_373|this is a big big win.
p292_374|as two candidates are proposed a vote is taken.
p292_375|that's an equally important factor.
p292_376|we were given a break.
p292_377|it is a hard act to follow the winning act.
p292_378|that would have killed the match.
p292_379|that's not like us at all.
p292_380|scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p292_381|tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p292_382|you have to rely on each other.
p292_383|politics is a tough game.
p292_384|this season has been a nightmare.
p292_385|everyone could see the joke.
p292_386|he is just a wonderful actor.
p292_387|billy knew he was attracted to women.
p292_388|the occasion was a conference on scottish art.
p292_389|such cases are on the increase.
p292_390|this was not helpful.
p292_391|the police are not the target.
p292_392|it's a true story.
p292_393|john prescott is john prescott as the prime minister would say.
p292_394|but that title is a mistake.
p292_395|it is not true to hollywood nor the player.
p292_396|i'd rather have been playing.
p292_397|i am immensely sad.
p292_398|several others were absent.
p292_399|it is surprising to come back this way.
p292_400|life is about people and how you feel about people.
p292_401|could they perhaps be related?
p292_402|we all thought we were going to die.
p292_403|i knew she was going to win.
p292_404|what is the barnett formula?
p292_405|clark is back on top form.
p292_406|a suspicion was not enough.
p292_407|it will probably be my last too.
p292_408|i'm surprised to hear it from tony.
p292_409|it is good for europe.
p292_410|i am looking forward to this film.
p292_411|colour was at the core of his life.
p292_412|they would not tell us.
p292_413|the balance is all wrong in this country.
p292_414|this was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p292_415|it is my decision and my decision alone.
p292_416|a venue was found.
p292_417|i will always remember the horrible images.
p292_418|it can happen to you it can happen to anyone.
p292_419|but a surprise is in store.
p292_420|you can cope with it.
p292_421|he was back to square one.
p292_422|we didn't get any from his face.
p292_423|but honestly there is no need for us to panic.
p292_424|it's time for a change.
p293_001|please call stella.
p293_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p293_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p293_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p293_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p293_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p293_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p293_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p293_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p293_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p293_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p293_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p293_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p293_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p293_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p293_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p293_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p293_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p293_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p293_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p293_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p293_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p293_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p293_025|it's not of course a concert hall.
p293_026|theatre is not a museum.
p293_027|it is not true to hollywood nor the player.
p293_028|all my training is for athens.
p293_029|subs not used mcculloch.
p293_030|i couldn't really work outside edinburgh.
p293_032|we are satisfied with this outcome.
p293_033|several others were absent.
p293_034|i asked for a picture and she said no problem.
p293_035|there is a lot of heroin about.
p293_036|there is a growing anger among the group.
p293_037|i have got to adopt the same approach.
p293_038|seven people were later detained by police.
p293_039|it's a sensible management decision.
p293_040|just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p293_041|i would just like someone to confess.
p293_042|sub not used mccormick.
p293_043|we can be proud of our achievements.
p293_044|clark is back on top form.
p293_045|he denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p293_046|lothian and borders police are also involved.
p293_047|that was the theory anyway.
p293_048|ferguson must take the blame.
p293_049|this is thought to mean sometime next week.
p293_050|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p293_051|stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p293_052|it is a large number.
p293_053|we felt at the moment it was not possible.
p293_054|general you didn't get a modified.
p293_055|it does not even have a staff shortage.
p293_056|that is our unfinished business.
p293_057|this is far too high.
p293_058|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p293_059|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p293_060|but the foundations have been laid.
p293_061|this was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p293_062|so they will settle again.
p293_063|he had other things on his mind.
p293_064|why did it take a concerted campaign?
p293_065|let us hope so.
p293_066|it can happen to you it can happen to anyone.
p293_067|a lot of people had to wait and people still do.
p293_068|it felt like my support system was leaving.
p293_069|a ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p293_070|i was shaking on the blocks.
p293_071|so the challenge is against ourselves.
p293_072|you see my back has gone.
p293_073|it has been a lovely family occasion.
p293_074|we've had our problems at the club.
p293_075|his behaviour today has been disgusting.
p293_076|more than half of the school collapsed.
p293_077|we also hope to meet the men.
p293_078|i can live with just the one.
p293_079|all the people thought that we would die.
p293_080|sometimes they come off.
p293_081|a teacher is really about unity.
p293_082|our nation has been changed by this event.
p293_083|however my position remains the same.
p293_084|however it's good to turn the page.
p293_085|there are plenty examples.
p293_086|self control is just one instalment.
p293_087|it's an hour of the same response.
p293_088|i could not believe what they were saying.
p293_089|a hard act to follow but it is being followed.
p293_090|will he be given time?
p293_091|beyond that would have been outrageous.
p293_092|i seem to keep this for the majors.
p293_093|the lowest increase was recorded in dundee.
p293_094|we've been overwhelmed by the response.
p293_095|her presence was almost everywhere.
p293_096|but the cost to his health was enormous.
p293_097|it has been hijacked.
p293_098|and he's the first to see that and say that.
p293_099|they must put them back.
p293_100|you do have a way out.
p293_101|committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p293_102|this is not a european army.
p293_103|these guys are looking for business.
p293_104|and also when he does not have the ball.
p293_105|i have also been delighted with stevie.
p293_106|it was different in the endurance events.
p293_107|they will now have to justify their position.
p293_108|it didn't help him as far as we had seen.
p293_109|the objective was achieved.
p293_110|so in a sense it was a government subsidy.
p293_111|look at his last couple of records.
p293_112|there is no musical background in his family.
p293_113|the cost of war is more than that.
p293_114|you the british people are the boss.
p293_115|the door is open.
p293_116|pr for westminster is their holy grail.
p293_117|she doesn't know me know anything about me.
p293_118|these are long term investments.
p293_119|their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p293_120|he also wants to play in this game and that's important.
p293_121|this is excellent news for glasgow.
p293_122|if that is the perception that has to be addressed.
p293_123|eriksson would have approved.
p293_124|you ask the question.
p293_125|next league matches motherwell dunfermline.
p293_126|eriksson though was having none of it.
p293_127|the taliban response was swift.
p293_128|saddam hussein has made the case against himself.
p293_129|in fact they should have scored three times.
p293_130|they have their own interests and techniques.
p293_131|well it was part of our ongoing discussions.
p293_132|the firm was down and almost out.
p293_133|reviving the scottish open is one option.
p293_134|fifteen minutes later they were found.
p293_135|it was very very difficult for me to look at this.
p293_136|that is why we are here.
p293_137|hopefully he will get a lucky break.
p293_138|somehow they got out.
p293_139|the house was so well alight.
p293_140|i've been very nervous.
p293_141|ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
p293_142|however the second goal was about to be delivered.
p293_143|the proposals were never taken seriously.
p293_144|the treasury denied the claims.
p293_145|the same goes for mckenna.
p293_146|perhaps it should stay there.
p293_147|you can be sure we will have problems.
p293_148|sometimes you get them sometimes you don't.
p293_149|we had to take action to protect them.
p293_150|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p293_151|our policy is clear.
p293_152|i think we have a very strong case.
p293_153|who would be out there singing?
p293_154|it is very simple no one is forced to compete.
p293_155|however his remarks were heavily qualified.
p293_156|it's something he has worked very hard on.
p293_157|horses have some sense.
p293_158|last night the extent of the damage was emerging.
p293_159|treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p293_160|the only answer is a public inquiry.
p293_161|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p293_162|however the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p293_163|politics is a tough game.
p293_164|darrell was however adamant.
p293_165|the rear of the plane was on fire.
p293_166|it is physical but it is also good.
p293_167|it's unfair on her.
p293_168|so easy does it.
p293_169|i just want to enjoy myself.
p293_170|we are concerned that things should be safe.
p293_171|at this point we can only speculate.
p293_172|family members are at her bedside.
p293_173|i am very shocked.
p293_174|the people here are quite reserved.
p293_175|when will this change?
p293_176|it has made me feel good.
p293_177|it's been such a long haul.
p293_178|this gives us a lot of practice.
p293_179|sadly too many of them are similar.
p293_180|sadly it took a tragedy to change things.
p293_181|however it is believed they were from the highlands.
p293_182|britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p293_183|the crucial strike was yet to come.
p293_184|it was his job to check.
p293_185|this is the stuff of live music.
p293_186|mrs taylor is taking legal advice.
p293_187|of course we know them from their work in the theatre.
p293_188|but allen is deadly serious.
p293_189|it's a huge amount.
p293_190|the fire was falling from the sky.
p293_191|so he was anxious to try something new.
p293_192|but he is something special is he not?
p293_193|this is simply unjust.
p293_194|a final decision is expected by friday.
p293_195|we will do so again.
p293_196|we will only move forward.
p293_197|i'm a bit annoyed.
p293_198|it ignores the future.
p293_199|i am just looking to god.
p293_200|i always savour the company of the voice.
p293_201|what's the rush?
p293_202|it would also take time.
p293_203|nothing is ruled out.
p293_204|we owe it to the public of strathclyde.
p293_205|he doesn't have to like it but he must accept it.
p293_206|i expected a victory the pain is enormous.
p293_207|he was also married with two children.
p293_208|his conclusion is upbeat.
p293_209|clearly we could go on like this all day.
p293_210|the investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p293_211|pitt of course would play the lead singer.
p293_212|i'm just gonna hit the shot.
p293_213|he will not be carrying out any surgery.
p293_214|the replacements made a big difference.
p293_215|we expect to come through on thursday.
p293_216|a web site's planned for november.
p293_217|he didn't know it was his audition but it was.
p293_218|the salary changes are long overdue.
p293_219|he is indeed the grandson of travelling folk.
p293_220|who would be in that desert?
p293_221|it will take some time to establish.
p293_222|sadly the jury were not convinced.
p293_223|we never got off the bus.
p293_224|i've had six days of rehearsal.
p293_225|bill clinton always had an idea to sell.
p293_226|they have to come up with a solution.
p293_227|the report will be launched in glasgow today.
p293_228|these will be finally corrected by next week.
p293_229|they will form a tribute.
p293_230|we had no idea that this letter existed.
p293_231|i think in three dimensions.
p293_232|three others were wounded.
p293_233|they had four children together.
p293_234|it's a way of making a mark.
p293_235|there is a great carry over value.
p293_236|life as many people know it in other words.
p293_237|that was my own personal decision.
p293_238|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p293_239|she returned home a few days later.
p293_240|i have been here for only three months.
p293_241|so what's wrong with scotland?
p293_242|she had been in germany for medical treatment.
p293_243|how can they engage with the work?
p293_244|it gave me something to focus on.
p293_245|we live by the rule of law.
p293_246|he doesn't need to be told he knows the truth.
p293_247|she is fulfilled by it.
p293_248|but one shouldn't go by that.
p293_249|nobody has been put on trial.
p293_250|advice and counselling will be offered.
p293_251|also he was flawed.
p293_252|that's why he plays for scotland.
p293_253|i just could not cope.
p293_254|they may differ on other issues.
p293_255|in short the club was broke.
p293_256|the protest will go ahead as planned.
p293_257|there is no dispute with the iraqi people.
p293_258|that fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p293_259|i find the whole affair disturbing.
p293_260|is it the players or is it the coaches?
p293_261|apart from that they would not be making any comment.
p293_262|the commons is too outdated.
p293_263|it feels like a privilege.
p293_264|we have got a full house tonight.
p293_265|it was not the greatest performance but it was effective.
p293_266|he will be advised by me.
p293_267|it's been quite a turnaround for miami.
p293_268|our children are our future.
p293_269|it's part of your life.
p293_270|the defender made an impressive debut.
p293_271|i was furious about it.
p293_272|they were not doing it too well either.
p293_273|it is typical of me.
p293_274|there are two offerings from scotland.
p293_275|life becomes a song.
p293_276|i know you went back this morning.
p293_277|it has however been a long time coming.
p293_278|this avalanche is just beginning.
p293_279|that however is only part of their story.
p293_280|yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p293_281|i was living with my mum.
p293_282|we very much regret that it has occurred.
p293_283|the whole process was so different.
p293_284|the bbc was a disgrace.
p293_285|they feel it belongs to them.
p293_286|i don't know why she is not here.
p293_287|they certainly do not socialise.
p293_288|police have refused to name the couple involved.
p293_289|they have got their position we have got our position.
p293_290|there was still more disquiet in israel.
p293_291|he had played well in that central role.
p293_292|we told them in june.
p293_293|if so we want to hear from them.
p293_294|they never gave up hope.
p293_295|construction is due to begin in february.
p293_296|i'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p293_297|it was just another race and yesterday is history.
p293_298|the red card was okay.
p293_300|we remain committed to it as does the government.
p293_301|but they will not be compelled to join.
p293_302|it will vote with the us.
p293_303|there will be no disruption to teaching.
p293_304|sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p293_305|no we had nothing to do with the jews.
p293_306|again the verdict was not proven.
p293_307|we've just got to work a bit better.
p293_308|the likelihood is that it will be negative.
p293_309|that suggests that out fitness is good.
p293_310|but she's also beautiful behind the face.
p293_311|four had been brought down.
p293_312|the british public is nothing if not fickle.
p293_313|such adjustments have been the salvation of united.
p293_314|it is also claimed that he was murdered.
p293_315|we will build upon the basic state pension.
p293_316|last year however was a different story.
p293_317|i'm confident we can turn things around.
p293_318|tomorrow we begin again as new yorkers.
p293_319|frankly they have to crack down.
p293_320|eleven events are required.
p293_321|the ministers are now to make their decision.
p293_322|the palace said the queen was deeply saddened.
p293_323|that's just the kind of thing we have.
p293_324|i bought a car at auction.
p293_325|you've gotten all the facts.
p293_326|it possibly depends on the position.
p293_327|life is too short.
p293_328|what is the working families tax credit?
p293_329|the event has now gone to helsinki.
p293_330|he's very young but he is growing up.
p293_331|he is in charge on the pitch.
p293_332|detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p293_333|sometimes it's not what you say that counts.
p293_334|for his opposite number this was a just triumph.
p293_335|they had asked not to be named.
p293_336|well until recently he didn't think so.
p293_337|a whole range of factors are involved.
p293_338|there may be some work in construction but not enough.
p293_339|they would love to do more films.
p293_340|i have great sympathy with these people.
p293_341|he wanted someone young and ambitious.
p293_342|mr blair is the problem in scotland not the solution.
p293_343|it raises a serious question mark.
p293_344|he is dying from cancer.
p293_345|the package has been properly costed.
p293_346|the attitude and commitment was decent.
p293_347|the feeling is awesome.
p293_348|he quit in october.
p293_349|the family also declined to discuss the case.
p293_350|famously though there was a catch.
p293_351|today we begin to answer that question.
p293_352|barry will be able to handle this.
p293_354|failure is a curious concept.
p293_355|but it can happen for tiger.
p293_356|patients will be partners in decision making.
p293_357|we're very excited and challenged by the project.
p293_358|the science is well known the solution is simple.
p293_359|the initial reaction was disbelief.
p293_360|all these things have an impact.
p293_361|for some it might not make too much difference.
p293_362|i now know that from memory.
p293_363|she is believed to be in south africa.
p293_364|i felt we had fallen back a little.
p293_365|he doesn't even know who he is.
p293_366|this is our chance in northern ireland.
p293_367|hopefully the goals will return on wednesday.
p293_368|the men are safe and unharmed.
p293_369|i don't know what we're doing wrong.
p293_370|i can't wait for the outdoors.
p293_371|it didn't work against sweden but that was the intention.
p293_372|his arguments were supported by mr bevan.
p293_373|but it was to no avail.
p293_374|i don't think the referees are against us.
p293_375|the whole experience has left me bitter.
p293_376|it is not a road of life.
p293_377|this must be kept in total perspective.
p293_378|it is three years at present.
p293_379|my husband was fighting for his life.
p293_380|as often as not the cause remains a mystery.
p293_381|when he took over it really took off.
p293_382|a contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p293_383|the penalty was the turning point.
p293_384|i have chosen to do this research.
p293_385|it was even worse than at home.
p293_386|michael's putting on a brave face.
p293_387|this isn't something the labour government has invented.
p293_388|i am sure that this will happen again.
p293_389|he is very unlikely to feature against ireland.
p293_390|all were within range of israeli cities.
p293_391|i do not believe they are.
p293_392|the aircraft was totally destroyed.
p293_393|what happens when the funding is exhausted.
p293_394|she's the runner she makes the decisions.
p293_395|this is a completely new experience for me.
p293_396|i should never have come over to fife.
p293_397|what kind of person is he?
p293_398|their bid was a very good one.
p293_399|green is desperate to play in the open.
p293_400|and this tournament will travel.
p294_001|please call stella.
p294_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p294_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p294_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p294_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p294_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p294_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p294_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p294_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p294_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p294_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p294_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p294_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p294_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p294_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p294_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p294_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p294_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p294_019|since then physicists have found that it's not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p294_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p294_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p294_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p294_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p294_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p294_025|they were the better team on the night.
p294_026|the show is sold out like the others in the run.
p294_027|it means we have to have some patience.
p294_028|for the moment our position remains the same.
p294_029|i was pregnant and very worried.
p294_030|he said she was mad.
p294_031|they were impressive against france.
p294_032|i am delighted at murray's appointment.
p294_033|the airport was even different.
p294_034|other people had looked at it.
p294_035|a neighbour said the street was shocked.
p294_036|michael he is running
p294_037|he was taken to hospital but later died.
p294_038|their ambition is to go back.
p294_039|he got the same story.
p294_040|my view has now changed completely.
p294_041|i've been dying for an hour.
p294_042|it wasn't a flight of fancy.
p294_043|we're playing away from home and that's it.
p294_044|i'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p294_045|they tend to be female and retired.
p294_046|who was the mystery mp?
p294_047|this was no accident.
p294_048|i'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p294_049|we've all done it
p294_050|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p294_051|hopefully that'll come from someone on our side.
p294_052|the course record was in his name.
p294_053|but we welcome this document.
p294_054|what is the point of jailing him?
p294_055|we should not bring him into a dispute.
p294_056|this is a possible way forward.
p294_057|i am not here to get even.
p294_058|freedom from serbia is a growing objective.
p294_059|we are only human.
p294_060|i went with the mood.
p294_061|i think we'll just keep it.
p294_062|debate is not just talk.
p294_063|how is he enjoying life as a senior?
p294_064|it is all about having physical evidence.
p294_065|people remember the tories in office.
p294_066|what kind of inclusion is that?
p294_067|i fell in love with it right away.
p294_068|domestic abuse is related to power and control.
p294_069|it makes for an interesting conference.
p294_070|i don't have any answer for them.
p294_071|it took about five or six hours.
p294_072|i found the course inspiring.
p294_073|two things were clear from the new programme.
p294_074|this is the real thing now.
p294_075|until they came to do it.
p294_076|she now lives in london.
p294_077|it will not be a long campaign.
p294_078|subs not used mcgraw.
p294_079|three bystanders were killed.
p294_080|one policeman was killed.
p294_081|they could not have done more for me.
p294_082|it was like a vacuum.
p294_083|that was enough for the committee.
p294_084|it is a very genuine prospect.
p294_085|it is the tip of the iceberg.
p294_086|we have to focus on what is important.
p294_087|they have to work so hard.
p294_088|it's not very pretty but it's effective.
p294_089|seven british members of the club are missing.
p294_090|he had just returned from a run.
p294_091|there's a strong involvement.
p294_092|now though he has an incentive.
p294_093|but now it's back to golf.
p294_094|it should be a condition of employment.
p294_095|was it a signal?
p294_096|it may not even be possible.
p294_097|in fact they go hand in hand.
p294_098|i gave him a way out and he took it.
p294_099|so is that it then?
p294_100|you should have let it write the cards.
p294_101|it's annoying in a way.
p294_102|it's too close to call.
p294_103|it's a long process.
p294_104|i asked to take it up to glasgow.
p294_105|sacking john redwood is a disaster.
p294_106|the other conditions were not specified.
p294_107|i've never felt affection for emu.
p294_108|that's not part of the deal.
p294_109|that was the context of his remarks.
p294_110|this has gone on too long.
p294_111|we have great confidence in derek.
p294_112|my ambition is to tell a good story.
p294_113|i don't know the nature of the illness.
p294_114|the industry will try to get round it.
p294_115|who will deliver more service to scotland?
p294_116|i want to make a vigorous defence.
p294_117|and she got it.
p294_118|we are the weakest link.
p294_119|we have now no choice.
p294_120|my father and mother are.
p294_121|we don't know what happened after.
p294_122|did he just want to be on telly?
p294_123|he seems to be used to the attention.
p294_124|it's an hour of the same response.
p294_125|we have very real concerns about it.
p294_126|he has gone through the process before.
p294_127|people will see this over time.
p294_128|i can't speak for him.
p294_129|they were married in edinburgh last summer.
p294_130|the lowest increase was recorded in dundee.
p294_131|i can't see him reversing that.
p294_132|i'm deeply sorry they did.
p294_133|i can lead by example.
p294_134|i have had a wonderful career.
p294_135|it seemed to have direction.
p294_136|this takes the pressure off.
p294_137|it was different in the endurance events.
p294_138|above all the approach is upbeat.
p294_139|the objective was achieved.
p294_140|it was a hugely popular decision.
p294_141|he invented the language.
p294_142|where are they?
p294_143|it's hard not to.
p294_144|it is a question of life and death.
p294_145|however there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p294_146|you ask the question.
p294_147|she was always a quality act.
p294_148|we are all very proud of her.
p294_149|i'm sure that is not.
p294_150|it's a great idea.
p294_151|it's like a score in some ways.
p294_152|it's a wonderful piece of water.
p294_153|feel the air the space.
p294_154|therein lies the problem.
p294_155|you feel the pride.
p294_156|we are well insured.
p294_157|i was quietly confident about getting the win.
p294_158|the treasury denied the claims.
p294_159|you've been working for four years.
p294_160|i am the son of sam.
p294_161|there is no shortage of commitment.
p294_162|such as it is.
p294_163|he deserves a second chance.
p294_164|he also admitted.
p294_165|there was no change in the strategy.
p294_166|there's been a mistake.
p294_167|it had until tomorrow to comply.
p294_168|genetic assessment is crucial.
p294_169|i enjoy my work.
p294_170|we have managed to get it under control.
p294_171|we have a genuine budget in place.
p294_172|art is still a risky investment.
p294_173|it was little else.
p294_174|these things can happen.
p294_175|family members are at her bedside.
p294_176|you have to go to the edges.
p294_177|i'm looking forward to facing the irishmen.
p294_178|harry will be up for it.
p294_179|he could tell you.
p294_180|my place is in the kitchen.
p294_181|he was indeed a thoroughly decent man.
p294_182|a decision is expected in september.
p294_183|it was a big departure.
p294_184|that's the name of the game though.
p294_185|it's a huge amount.
p294_186|the fire was falling from the sky.
p294_187|i want my mum.
p294_188|this is simply unjust.
p294_189|the first minister is an addict.
p294_190|its role is not to interfere.
p294_191|it is becoming a bit of a habit.
p294_192|you can't believe a word.
p294_193|something happened on that island.
p294_194|you can't get a mortgage.
p294_195|it is misleading to compare the two.
p294_196|i want a career.
p294_197|he said nothing to waiting journalists.
p294_198|o leary was clearly disgusted.
p294_199|that's been the case for a while.
p294_200|when it is ready it will be signed.
p294_201|all options are on the table.
p294_202|it will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p294_203|we now have a moment of hope.
p294_204|they should not be blamed for it.
p294_205|our traditions and cultures remain the same.
p294_206|the first eviction takes place on sunday.
p294_207|it will take some time to establish.
p294_208|this club is perfect for me.
p294_209|and do you know it just wasn't the same.
p294_210|this came as no great surprise to anyone.
p294_211|i love this job.
p294_212|i have no secrets.
p294_213|we are very very pleased with the response.
p294_214|he doesn't need to be told he knows the truth.
p294_215|they will form a tribute.
p294_216|we're very very excited.
p294_217|it's not a question of talking.
p294_218|he was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p294_219|then they killed another three.
p294_220|we are not a retailer we provide a service.
p294_221|the six others were injured.
p294_222|she has so much to offer.
p294_223|they are not the answer to staff shortages.
p294_224|it should be a pretty exciting session.
p294_225|gas is too expensive.
p294_226|advice and counselling will be offered.
p294_227|are we going mainstream?
p294_228|i could not believe what they were saying.
p294_229|the protest will go ahead as planned.
p294_230|who will run the bigger show?
p294_231|general you didn't get a modified.
p294_232|i'm not a little girl.
p294_233|we have seen the future and it is different.
p294_234|who does he think will win?
p294_235|we're talking about one or two years.
p294_236|i just have to accept that.
p294_237|he was overwhelmed by the response.
p294_238|they will do nothing for the local people.
p294_239|do it for us now.
p294_240|we got the guarantee.
p294_241|i couldn't have asked for better.
p294_242|that is however the only part of the story.
p294_243|but happily the story is true.
p294_244|they are not suitable.
p294_245|some days are different from others.
p294_247|everything else is the same.
p294_248|they never gave up hope.
p294_249|but it was a pleasure.
p294_250|there are no excuses left for us.
p294_251|mental health is a massive issue.
p294_252|his director of football is leaving.
p294_253|we don't want to be too intrusive.
p294_254|their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p294_255|there are still some matters to be discussed.
p294_256|this would give scotland around eight members.
p294_257|i get on him he gets on me.
p294_258|they are in care for a reason.
p294_259|a scotsman has to defend his castle.
p294_260|i haven't a clue.
p294_261|it has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p294_262|i thought he was terrific.
p294_263|a statement is expected in april.
p294_264|it possibly depends on the position.
p294_265|this will have no effect on the championship.
p294_266|we didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p294_267|i would love to travel with it.
p294_268|detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p294_269|it is a common condition in children.
p294_270|we will work through the night.
p294_271|i also thought this is a feature film.
p294_272|for now they have gone as far as they can.
p294_273|boy is the town a mess.
p294_274|it's as simple as that.
p294_275|we've been here before.
p294_276|neither of them was badly hurt.
p294_277|from there it was a success story.
p294_278|it is a very disturbing picture for men.
p294_279|i have come here to fight the boxer not the fans.
p294_280|it was one in the afternoon.
p294_281|i've never seen them down here.
p294_282|for some it might not make too much difference.
p294_283|this is our unfinished business.
p294_284|this is our chance in northern ireland.
p294_285|he had asked if they had the script.
p294_286|it didn't work against sweden but that was the intention.
p294_287|this could take a few days.
p294_288|a great deal was achieved.
p294_289|so it was sad.
p294_290|it's a blunt instrument anyway.
p294_291|there did not need to be a miracle.
p294_292|this could also affect the sentencing.
p294_293|that case has still not been settled.
p294_294|what do they do anyway?
p294_295|they've got a mountain to climb.
p294_296|it just would not work.
p294_297|the acting left a lot to be desired.
p294_298|who will provide the wine?
p294_299|we started from scratch.
p294_300|there was no happiness.
p294_301|their bid was a very good one.
p294_302|everything is so commercial.
p294_303|and this tournament will travel.
p294_304|could it have been better spent?
p294_305|if that is the case it is a breakthrough.
p294_306|the order went out.
p294_307|cinema is a communal experience.
p294_308|the appeal is impartial.
p294_309|you could see he was thinking about it.
p294_310|he added we are full of anger.
p294_311|they have nowhere else to go.
p294_312|however it seems that he got it wrong.
p294_313|we work for the athlete.
p294_314|it is three years at present.
p294_315|the document is a starting point for discussion.
p294_316|we all make mistakes.
p294_317|it didn't put me off.
p294_318|now they have found out the truth.
p294_319|it is an impressive record.
p294_320|johnson was pretty low.
p294_321|we know we have done wrong.
p294_322|she was married with one son.
p294_323|i wanted to drop out.
p294_324|i told you so.
p294_325|he's a good player but he's not the only one.
p294_326|which is where the manager comes in.
p294_327|is that what people we want?
p294_328|there are so many unanswered questions.
p294_329|then it was into a series of classes.
p294_330|he wants to play in the champions league.
p294_331|i'm so happy that she did.
p294_332|the need for further investment is obvious.
p294_333|iraq has no interest in war.
p294_334|it's hard but we have had so much to do.
p294_335|but it took a lot of bottle.
p294_336|holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p294_337|that period was a struggle.
p294_338|no one else was hurt.
p294_339|what's it for?
p294_340|downing street defended the scale of the awards.
p294_341|anything can happen at any moment.
p294_342|she is an imposing presence.
p294_343|there are moments of joy in politics.
p294_344|is a drug dealer?
p294_345|where are you taking her?
p294_346|yesterday he was busy in his office.
p294_347|it's just not our biggest problem.
p294_348|the result could be all down to turnout.
p294_349|i'm not going to change from it.
p294_350|there were no violations.
p294_351|that was the type of man he was.
p294_352|they are not falling now.
p294_353|they had to explain it.
p294_354|we didn't mean to kill him.
p294_355|the support of britain is assumed.
p294_356|so far he has not done so.
p294_357|he completely loses control.
p294_358|no decision on that was taken.
p294_359|my fitness was very poor.
p294_360|the trial continues today.
p294_361|people come to see the highlands.
p294_362|europe is a bonus.
p294_363|it is also used to buy coffins.
p294_364|i've got to provide for my family.
p294_365|such debate is pointless.
p294_366|and it had two seats.
p294_367|cooking is intricate and complex.
p294_368|he found it very hard to understand.
p294_369|but it would change the context.
p294_370|but who was driving it?
p294_371|we recorded it at our own expense.
p294_372|but opponents were quick to criticise.
p294_373|try to save us.
p294_374|we also have had to work the dark side if you will.
p294_375|we need to increase the membership.
p294_376|social workers are on stand by to help.
p294_377|certainly there is much on the agenda.
p294_378|there could be a way back.
p294_379|he edited the press release.
p294_380|visitors were also impressed.
p294_381|it was very very difficult for me to look at this.
p294_382|thankfully mr campbell was able to help.
p294_383|are there muscular problems?
p294_384|we had our chances.
p294_385|however many questions remained unanswered.
p294_386|i told her and she was extremely grateful.
p294_387|he is in the queue.
p294_388|but what is?
p294_389|it wasn't about her singing though.
p294_390|we have other options.
p294_391|calvin was back at his best today.
p294_392|my mind was made up.
p294_393|nine days later he suffered another attack.
p294_394|and rugby fans can help.
p294_395|the council's concern is very simple.
p294_396|we are on the path of change.
p294_397|rangers didn't turn up by the way.
p294_398|no other vehicle was involved in the accident.
p294_399|it's very simple no one is forced to compete.
p294_400|of course it doesn't all come off.
p294_401|in fact he should never have been in the field.
p294_402|he promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p294_403|we will deal with the refugees.
p294_404|the pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p294_405|it's a tragedy for the area.
p294_406|it was very well received.
p294_407|i don't think there's going to be one.
p294_408|if you could find it.
p294_409|such is the ego involved.
p294_410|mr wilson has received no such request.
p294_411|it raises the edge.
p294_412|it was not known to myself.
p294_413|it is a delight on every level.
p294_414|would it really be good to shorten it?
p294_415|i don't entirely buy that.
p294_416|england could not take anything for granted however.
p294_417|i saw it in a different way.
p294_418|or rather it isn't.
p294_419|we have every respect for michelle.
p294_420|mr blunkett was convinced.
p294_421|the auction will be held tomorrow.
p294_422|it was really enjoyable on saturday.
p294_423|athletics is on a roll in the country.
p294_424|he died at the hands of his captors.
p295_001|please call stella.
p295_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p295_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p295_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p295_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p295_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p295_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p295_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p295_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p295_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p295_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p295_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p295_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p295_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p295_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p295_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p295_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p295_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p295_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p295_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p295_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p295_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p295_025|it has never been worthwhile.
p295_026|she was on the edge of breaking point.
p295_027|however the following year the cancer returned.
p295_028|because we do not need it.
p295_029|it has been supremely successful.
p295_030|he's a good player but he's not the only one.
p295_031|which is where the manager comes in.
p295_032|thankfully that doesn't happen that often.
p295_033|three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p295_034|we thought we would never see them again.
p295_035|after that it's a step into the unknown.
p295_036|she asked me for the appointment with me.
p295_037|he must not be removed from office.
p295_038|that means an extra two years.
p295_039|i think he was nervous to begin with.
p295_040|our children are the future of our society.
p295_041|i'm sure he would love it.
p295_042|a final agreement has not yet been completed.
p295_043|it's just not our biggest problem.
p295_044|it is just like any other club.
p295_045|everything is possible in football.
p295_046|i'm sure he didn't mean it.
p295_048|we are going to new broomfield to win.
p295_049|colin is free to speak with other teams.
p295_050|he declined to give further details.
p295_051|i think it was entirely the right decision.
p295_052|broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p295_053|for sure we want to win it.
p295_054|there was only one problem the teacher was still there
p295_055|such debate is pointless.
p295_056|he is helping police with their inquiries.
p295_057|we recorded it at our own expense.
p295_058|a formal decision will be announced within months.
p295_059|i knew there was a challenge for me.
p295_060|social workers are on stand by to help.
p295_061|i just have no maternal instincts.
p295_062|if you're going to do it do it right.
p295_063|they have a car and cannot afford another.
p295_064|it is after all a very funny play.
p295_065|can you imagine a world without design?
p295_066|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p295_067|and he listens to his artists as well.
p295_068|i really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p295_069|so now we know the secret.
p295_070|he's right up to a point.
p295_071|we would have looked out for each other.
p295_072|i had no choice but to leave.
p295_073|where does he go from here?
p295_074|lothian and borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p295_075|this time there were no such rewards.
p295_076|but then they scored their fourth.
p295_077|he said my own position is quite simple.
p295_078|but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p295_079|it has to find out what went wrong.
p295_080|people are already enjoying it.
p295_081|we're just delighted to be back on top.
p295_082|or is it the european approach?
p295_083|i had found my vision.
p295_084|mr wilson has received no such request.
p295_085|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p295_086|there is a contract in existence for allan.
p295_087|i don't entirely buy that.
p295_088|we are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p295_089|it is giving out the wrong message.
p295_090|it didn't come as any great surprise.
p295_091|for these people the ruling is very welcome.
p295_092|as a nation we must become more active.
p295_093|nothing has changed from the season before.
p295_094|i'm not thinking too much about the tour.
p295_095|i had some time with aston villa.
p295_096|we recognise it as a key area.
p295_097|the mood was euphoric.
p295_098|the time of judgment has arrived.
p295_099|mind you it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p295_100|you can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p295_101|we want to be separate from our neighbours.
p295_102|eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p295_103|have you heard anything from paramount?
p295_104|wednesday night was a difficult time for britton.
p295_105|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p295_106|this has been a terrible experience.
p295_107|he had a different agenda entirely.
p295_108|casualties are a problem for the kremlin.
p295_109|we're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p295_110|that's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p295_111|she said she would not welcome the flowers.
p295_112|it is reform in return for resources.
p295_113|it offers a different viewpoint.
p295_114|the band was good and it's been a great day.
p295_115|i haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p295_116|i have no plans to retire.
p295_117|the scots are however in good company.
p295_118|suddenly the fir park side were in disarray.
p295_119|there were far more pressing matters to consider.
p295_120|the whole thing in general is moving on.
p295_121|this is a test of our character.
p295_122|they were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p295_123|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p295_124|it is however an unlikely outcome.
p295_125|the look on his face was something special.
p295_126|you have a very persuasive president.
p295_127|sure we have problems.
p295_128|we will provide immediate access.
p295_129|axis itself was created from that exercise.
p295_130|five years later the deception continued.
p295_131|obviously people are worried in the west midlands.
p295_132|i can't see myself in one of those.
p295_133|we are pursuing legal action against the government.
p295_134|i wondered about changing back to rugby.
p295_135|he added we have the same desire.
p295_137|it was for me like a week in heaven.
p295_138|i haven't had a lesson in four years.
p295_139|that however is the end of the good news.
p295_140|seven people were later detained by police.
p295_141|i got very very tired.
p295_142|what did you learn in school today?
p295_143|he certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p295_144|it does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p295_145|he's working hard on that right now.
p295_146|the jury is still out.
p295_147|clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p295_148|at the moment the success in germany is good.
p295_149|i can't say that this is very usual.
p295_150|we opened up and everything was gone.
p295_151|however everyone should do it once in their life.
p295_152|we are right at the heart of europe.
p295_153|i try to be open to experience.
p295_154|i remember it clearly.
p295_155|i'm sure they will be very happy.
p295_156|why do you want to come to edinburgh?
p295_157|we must get the three points.
p295_158|there has been a fair bit in between too.
p295_159|i feel alive and good today.
p295_160|we're in england for the time being.
p295_161|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p295_162|david trimble has sold out.
p295_163|everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p295_164|the voters are our masters.
p295_165|this is great news a wonderful addition to the programme.
p295_166|he is willing to pay the required amount.
p295_167|these awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p295_168|he should emerge as the winner.
p295_169|that's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p295_170|we've had an enjoyable adventure.
p295_171|the story was being repeated across scotland.
p295_172|you're not going to forget something like that.
p295_173|they are in the euro.
p295_174|the driver was unhurt.
p295_175|anything that can be done the government will do.
p295_176|it's all about money money money.
p295_177|a bit of match fitness is required.
p295_178|it was far from business as usual.
p295_179|there's nothing new in that argument.
p295_180|pity he couldn't produce a winning british team.
p295_181|the prime minister was informed on thursday.
p295_182|that's when you hope to take advantage.
p295_183|the deadline is real and absolute.
p295_184|no means testing will be required.
p295_185|the board would report to the scottish parliament.
p295_186|i'm sure it will go on.
p295_187|he was born in london of scottish parents.
p295_188|she is still very poorly.
p295_189|that's how he did the damage.
p295_190|he added it is all about the search for power.
p295_191|i need a publishing deal
p295_192|they tried to give her advice.
p295_193|if we live forever can we really be said to live?
p295_194|defeat is simply not an option.
p295_195|we have all been there at some point.
p295_196|recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p295_197|if they don't want to read it they don't have to.
p295_198|at least two women were among those arrested.
p295_199|my intentions are to go on like this.
p295_200|it is not attempting to offer a solution.
p295_201|she didn't tell me anything the night before.
p295_202|i will be having talks with the workforce.
p295_203|it's like an extension of your body.
p295_204|that's why he is a national treasure.
p295_205|it seems a waste of talents.
p295_206|hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p295_207|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p295_208|last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p295_209|we need to know more about her.
p295_210|and what is she escaping from?
p295_211|leaving the labour party is one thing.
p295_212|the music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p295_213|he has already received the freedom of aberdeen.
p295_214|what happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
p295_215|the distinction is also supported by doctors.
p295_216|i don't know how they make the weight.
p295_217|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p295_218|she is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p295_219|i'm very tired but it was worth it.
p295_220|the joint bid is still on course.
p295_221|this is the best moment of my career.
p295_222|my life has been turned upside down.
p295_224|why is he not fighting for the union?
p295_225|parole is a decision for me.
p295_226|it left me with a sadness.
p295_227|we don't have any senior players.
p295_228|not so it transpires.
p295_229|knowledge is everything at this level.
p295_230|this will help our confidence.
p295_231|he has a wealth of experience.
p295_232|it is a very beautiful city.
p295_233|her body was found on monday morning.
p295_234|his father and mother are in film production.
p295_235|it's about attitudes to change.
p295_236|i feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p295_237|we have seen the failure of politics.
p295_238|the party will make up its own mind.
p295_239|his remarks appear to have had an effect.
p295_240|i am very sorry to hear about this.
p295_241|i'm delighted and the players were brilliant.
p295_242|hopefully we can put in a performance.
p295_243|when he came to see me on monday.
p295_244|it was a budget for jobs for scotland.
p295_245|saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p295_246|their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p295_247|next league matches dundee united motherwell.
p295_248|it became a book by itself.
p295_249|here the fans have been fantastic.
p295_250|she was close to suicide at one stage.
p295_251|it is like a theatre of the absurd.
p295_252|what kind of festival is proposed?
p295_253|in my experience he does not do that.
p295_254|we're all involved in creating the work.
p295_255|when we started the album.
p295_256|we should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p295_257|controllers major concern is safety.
p295_258|this is your country.
p295_259|that's the most important thing for me.
p295_260|but it was the sensible thing to do.
p295_261|i think it'll be a great occasion.
p295_262|the committees are due to report next year.
p295_263|it was seriously unpleasant.
p295_264|what was the cause of all this outrage?
p295_265|now she has completed a family tradition.
p295_266|the bombing has had a huge influence.
p295_267|however the groups denied the claims.
p295_268|this latter point is hugely important.
p295_269|the airport was even different.
p295_270|whether this return was too soon.
p295_271|we're playing away from home and that's it.
p295_272|it may be down but new york is not out.
p295_273|in fact it was almost as if it was expected.
p295_274|the overall effect is impressive but distancing.
p295_275|my view has now completely changed.
p295_276|manchester united are the classic example.
p295_277|i've never regretted my decision.
p295_278|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p295_279|glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p295_280|look at the liberal democrats.
p295_281|surely it can't get any worse.
p295_282|he's in a lot of pain it is very distressing.
p295_283|we still have a long long way to go.
p295_284|he preferred to concentrate on the positive.
p295_285|the old firm are going nowhere.
p295_286|i'm not sure.
p295_287|but the championship is not over yet.
p295_288|we live in a world of large numbers.
p295_289|agents and coaches must be paid.
p295_290|charges against the pair were found not proven.
p295_291|tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p295_292|anyone can still win this tournament.
p295_293|my husband was angry.
p295_294|you're going to die.
p295_295|we have to put pressure on rangers.
p295_296|we're not really commenting on that.
p295_297|john prescott is john prescott as the prime minister would say.
p295_298|ferguson is not interested in the finances.
p295_299|could they perhaps be related?
p295_300|it should be a condition of employment.
p295_301|it was not being marketed properly.
p295_302|sub not used mccormick.
p295_303|they know their son was murdered.
p295_304|i love this tournament.
p295_305|nobody will be forced to work.
p295_306|we're all going to take a holiday.
p295_307|it is good for europe.
p295_308|this is your chance.
p295_309|they told him to go to drama school.
p295_310|in order to get there we have got to invest.
p295_311|it felt like my support system was leaving.
p295_312|the quality of life is difficult for them.
p295_313|i think they are right to be impatient.
p295_314|but honestly there is no need for us to panic.
p295_315|this year it will be billy crystal.
p295_316|the attack was totally out of the blue.
p295_317|it's a member of your family.
p295_318|it's an hour of the same response.
p295_319|there's a good chance of seeing something.
p295_320|we were in different places usually in cellars.
p295_321|thirteen people will be made redundant.
p295_322|this was the performance and the result they needed.
p295_323|it succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p295_324|it will not work in our favour.
p295_325|we're very close to making it in europe.
p295_326|it was hugely popular decision.
p295_327|the decision was left entirely to him.
p295_328|they have been contrasting years certainly.
p295_329|these findings are vitally important.
p295_330|that's always the case isn't it?
p295_331|i certainly think it should be there.
p295_332|i'm sure that they will learn.
p295_333|his commitment on the other hand is clear.
p295_335|if he could have prevented it happening he would have.
p295_336|this time however may have been different.
p295_337|we are well insured.
p295_338|however the second goal was about to be delivered.
p295_339|however that could alter following the latest case.
p295_340|it's like a garage.
p295_341|the last few weeks have been really bad.
p295_342|i believe in public services.
p295_343|the atmosphere is businesslike.
p295_344|but you can go beyond that condition.
p295_345|genetic assessment is crucial.
p295_346|tyson said he had made a mistake.
p295_347|four years is a long time.
p295_348|this process of attrition is expected to continue.
p295_349|no one wants to go through these things.
p295_350|you'll get on like a house on fire.
p295_351|all inquiries should be made to the police.
p295_352|worse still it can be infectious.
p295_353|they are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p295_354|nine days later he suffered another attack.
p295_355|he is very much in our thoughts.
p295_356|so what could be better than becoming captain?
p295_357|our great depression is our lives.
p295_358|he was elected as a councillor last year.
p295_359|you are always aware of the injury potential.
p295_360|but that is entirely a matter for them.
p295_361|but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p295_362|one minister said the reports were bizarre.
p295_363|you're not going to get hurt.
p295_364|but no decision has been made.
p295_365|our traditions and culture remain the same.
p295_366|i decided not to renew the contract.
p295_367|for us that decision was hard to understand.
p295_368|life as many people know it in other words.
p295_369|there are so many artists working in glasgow.
p295_370|i was a spectator that is as far as it goes.
p295_371|she makes me feel very proud.
p295_372|he had been surprised by the local reaction.
p295_373|the voices told me to do it.
p295_374|i am a committed european.
p295_375|there is no point in looking any further.
p295_376|a spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p295_377|i'm astonished by this decision.
p295_378|general you didn't get a modified.
p295_379|surely the answer is yes.
p295_380|it's part of your life.
p295_381|i could go on but none of these things is true.
p295_382|that sort of thing is long gone.
p295_383|our proposals are fully costed.
p295_384|we all started running forward.
p295_385|we did not want an absentee landlord.
p295_386|that however is only part of the story.
p295_387|it worked well in monaco.
p295_388|things were not easy from the outset.
p295_389|the team is in division one in spain.
p295_390|we don't even know his name.
p295_391|our position is not a logic of war.
p295_392|i have played really well all year.
p295_393|however the referee was not in the giving vein.
p295_394|it was visibly on fire.
p295_395|it was a fiery game.
p295_396|this would give scotland around eight members.
p295_397|that is european law.
p295_398|it was very lucky no one was killed.
p295_399|what has caused the demise of singing?
p295_400|he's close friend of gordon brown.
p295_401|that is not a position they enjoy.
p295_402|blair also had a penalty.
p295_403|we wanted to run away with her.
p295_404|scotland is an increasing concern for young people.
p295_405|i am not retiring.
p295_406|i didn't want to ignore the punters.
p295_407|boy is the town a mess.
p295_408|barry will be able to handle this.
p295_409|it is a very disturbing picture for men.
p295_410|to me it was just a miracle.
p295_411|after that though we are still waiting to see.
p295_412|that can happen so easily.
p295_413|this is a really serious issue.
p295_414|how do we get more people in?
p295_415|scotland needs to hear it too.
p295_416|there is too much at stake for that.
p295_418|we suspect he was pleased.
p295_419|everything is surrounded by confusion.
p295_420|but of course it isn't.
p295_421|we are almost at that point but not quite.
p295_422|i have to say for me the game was not.
p295_423|the document is a starting point for discussion.
p295_424|there is still the question of his health.
p297_001|please call stella.
p297_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p297_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p297_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p297_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p297_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p297_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p297_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p297_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p297_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p297_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p297_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.

p297_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p297_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p297_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p297_019|since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p297_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p297_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p297_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p297_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p297_025|but it's been kept to a minimum.
p297_026|we have gone on about him no end.

p297_059|people will see this over time.
p297_060|the tribunal continues today.
p297_061|basically the classical tradition won out.

p297_063|nobody can get at them there.
p297_065|it's not only my respect for them.
p297_066|the police have an awful lot to explain.
p297_067|big brother is listening to you.
p297_068|we will be paying agency rates.

p297_070|in the end however it all came together.
p297_071|they can be time consuming.
p297_072|it's a depressing difficult and demanding job.
p297_074|subtle it is not.

p297_096|however their reaction could not have been more different.
p297_097|i was doing well at the hustings.
p297_098|my wife and family are the support system.
p297_099|the scheme is hopelessly failing.
p297_100|the body follows the mind.
p297_101|that gives it a spirit.
p297_102|it isn't just a defining issue for them.
p297_103|however what is his calibre?

p297_164|it's always the same isn't it?
p297_165|don't get me wrong.
p297_166|he died from multiple injuries.
p297_167|they would never let him go.
p297_168|that could be in place by next year.
p297_169|i'm going to buy a car.
p297_170|which is worse?
p297_171|the property is owned by glasgow city council.
p297_172|i'm not talking about his career.
p297_173|scottish athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p297_174|but what lies ahead?

p297_177|i couldn't honestly tell you.
p297_178|the whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p297_179|the first time you read a play.
p297_180|we are committed to urgent action.
p297_181|i wish him well.
p297_182|others may be trying to catch up.
p297_183|i read it every year.
p297_184|i think we've got the balance right.
p297_185|there is no guarantee.
p297_186|some may end up in hospital.
p297_187|i'll tell you honestly.
p297_188|i let go the telephone and ran.

p297_206|from day one we were a family.
p297_207|fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p297_208|eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p297_209|it's a metaphor for consumption.
p297_210|he's an excellent defender strong and quick.
p297_211|that's hard for a woman.
p297_212|the atmosphere was electric.
p297_213|the boys are very confident.
p297_215|this club have been fair to me.
p297_216|secondly there are other options for patients.
p297_217|access has been a nightmare.
p297_218|what does she consider her greatest achievement?
p297_219|i'm looking at ways to do that now.
p297_220|the first is in whitehall the second in brussels.
p297_221|and we know that because we know the hairdresser.
p297_222|there has been no reaction from them.
p297_223|she failed in her action.
p297_224|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p297_225|it was more like a labour party rally.
p297_226|the group will report back in the summer.
p297_227|she looked so young.
p297_228|i will let you in on a secret.
p297_229|don't you think it was a fine performance?
p297_230|they were the best team but unlucky in the end.
p297_231|well they were the unlucky ones.
p297_232|she added the sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p297_233|we need a visionary producer.

p297_236|i saw it at a ruck.
p297_237|i have great confidence in annabelle.
p297_238|he's a sort of mystery figure.
p297_239|europe is not a threat to britain.
p297_240|he just wants to leave a legacy.
p297_241|every game against new zealand is.
p297_242|dialogue is the key.
p297_243|but they didn't much like that.
p297_244|we just wish they had done so before.
p297_245|i am sorry to hear this news.
p297_246|however we're capable of beating them.
p297_247|they chose the latter.
p297_248|i've not said anything to them they know.
p297_249|it's like a high school play.
p297_250|that is how it will be judged.
p297_251|it's there for people to look at.
p297_254|who did the recruiting?
p297_255|mr straw was home secretary at the time.
p297_256|however we had no failures in our side.
p297_257|this is his first movie.
p297_258|the farmers had no choice in the matter.
p297_259|they were assured that it would.
p297_260|i'm the one who has to suffer.
p297_261|she was charged with perjury.
p297_262|with us we just want them to respond.
p297_263|but something has been lost in the translation.
p297_264|that's the last thing they need.
p297_265|i made a big mistake.
p297_266|england against france is always a big game.
p297_267|when he came to see me on monday.
p297_268|government must recognise the problems of aberdeen.
p297_269|the criteria have changed.
p297_270|a new school will be built.
p297_271|who reminded him about the score?
p297_272|and it had been a marvellous occasion.
p297_273|i will not walk away from this job.
p297_274|mind you he hasn't been back for ages.
p297_275|how do you find the youngsters?
p297_276|they are declining elsewhere in the uk.
p297_277|it does not move which is amazing.
p297_278|we've always had a very positive attitude.
p297_279|part of england is not?
p297_280|it may have been a cry for help.
p297_281|there were no passengers on board.
p297_282|mr forrester reacted angrily.
p297_283|this is wrong but that's believed.
p297_284|they were not up to the required standard.
p297_285|finally they have a journey back to their youth.
p297_286|the whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p297_287|its people are inventive talented and diligent.
p297_288|we want to replicate that success.
p297_289|i couldn't put my finger on it.
p297_290|taxation should be simplified.
p297_291|that's a trend which will be encouraged.
p297_292|he looked at me before replying.
p297_293|but today was the real big one.
p297_294|someone else can do the cooking that night.
p297_295|that idea is rubbish.
p297_296|actually it turned out to be the concerto.
p297_297|he planned to relocate to scotland probably edinburgh.
p297_298|after that we made some changes.
p297_299|it has not yet opened to pupils.
p297_300|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p297_301|almost overnight he found his voice.
p297_302|i want my audience to be challenged.
p297_303|it was quite a new prescription.
p297_304|that too was over two years ago.
p297_305|who do you think you are?
p297_306|glasgow is a tour de force.
p297_307|i can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p297_308|i can understand why they have gone.
p297_309|they will give it a couple of years.
p297_310|your father was a good man.
p297_311|bob dylan's getting old.
p297_312|our number one goal is prevention.
p297_313|mr mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p297_314|and he is immensely loyal.
p297_315|the actor has met with mandela.
p297_316|but there was no time for that.
p297_317|he confirmed that there had been no warning.
p297_318|i am not against a further inquiry.
p297_319|the company's in good shape.
p297_320|there are different cultures in different departments.
p297_321|he was caught and fired.
p297_322|i was pregnant and very worried.
p297_323|davis is very supportive as a director.
p297_324|i'll never have problems with any football managers.
p297_325|it's only tackling congestion.
p297_326|i came into this world with nothing.
p297_327|you will never replace the child.
p297_328|i'm delighted at murray's appointment.
p297_329|off with their heads.
p297_330|there will have to be a full inquiry.
p297_331|they are now out in the cold.
p297_332|the way ahead is not easy.
p297_333|he intends to appeal the sentences.
p297_334|there is no smoking gun.
p297_335|his primary residence is scotland.
p297_336|it's an interesting title believing in britain.
p297_337|you are going to take away my life.
p297_338|that was one very hard game.
p297_339|officers recovered a second body in the area.
p297_340|this is the start of a slippery slope.
p297_341|i'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p297_342|don't hold your breath.
p297_343|the girls are ready to compete.
p297_344|o is there anything in the wound?
p297_345|mini rugby is a great thing.
p297_346|it was blown out of proportion.
p297_347|we certainly hope we have been successful.
p297_348|surely it can do better than that?
p297_349|it was all too little too late.
p297_350|substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p297_351|last night she refused to comment on the accident.
p297_352|it is only one night after all.
p297_353|the professor said the results were positive.
p297_354|gilbert was not amused.
p297_355|this should include procedures for personal imports.
p297_356|the course record was in his name.
p297_357|with him are the symbols of his faith.
p297_358|he said he had no reports of casualties.
p297_359|it's easy to see why.
p297_360|the board is currently resolving its differences.
p297_361|there is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p297_362|he had lost his confidence again.
p297_363|so where do we go from here?
p297_364|i was never alone with her right?
p297_365|this kind of traffic is commonplace.
p297_366|i think we'll just keep it.
p297_367|how is he enjoying life as a senior?
p297_368|it has proved a double whammy.
p297_369|we make good weapons.
p297_370|the vacancies are in support services and arts.
p297_371|what has changed?
p297_372|equally he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p297_373|it's like english in its underwear.
p297_374|i've been thinking about it for a year.
p297_375|this is the same old story.
p297_376|above all the aggression must be stopped.
p297_377|all of us in scotland should be vigilant.
p297_378|they finished second and third.
p297_379|everyone has his share of trouble.
p297_380|you need a licence to run a pub.
p297_381|he loved his job and working in newspapers.
p297_382|i don't want a burial service.
p297_383|and it's time for new leadership.
p297_384|i'm not sure.
p297_385|one might think that is a power.
p297_386|we've been calling for a level playing field.
p297_387|smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p297_388|we have big ideas.
p297_389|i hope the voters will respond.
p297_390|and who would argue with that?
p297_391|i believe that gap is nearly there.
p297_392|this is the real thing now.
p297_393|there is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p297_394|i ran to get out of the way.
p297_395|it was to be published next month.
p297_396|it's not a party no no.
p297_397|we have understood the problems for some time.
p297_398|here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p297_399|the work with alison was a great experience.
p297_400|she now lives in london.
p297_401|but every country has its own character.
p297_402|i don't have a problem with getting older.
p297_403|in addition it was just a breach of natural justice.
p297_404|i played really well on the back nine.
p297_405|last week he was taken into hospital.
p297_406|i wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p297_407|one policeman was killed.
p297_408|everything is now in place for manchester.
p297_409|my heart is not so sure.
p297_410|you have friends in the liberal democrats.
p297_411|you have to rely on each other.
p297_412|however it was well worth the wait.
p297_413|it is a thing of beauty to watch.
p297_414|however many of their victories have been close affairs.
p297_415|it's a delightful idea but a distancing one.
p297_416|however this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p297_417|this is his personal life.
p297_418|now he is trying to downgrade the media.
p297_419|hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p297_420|yet the consensus is it's worth it.
p297_421|it' s the tip of the iceberg.
p297_422|it's a true story.
p297_423|there was a substantial explosion.
p297_424|john prescott is john prescott as the prime minister would say.
p298_001|please call stella.
p298_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p298_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p298_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p298_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p298_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p298_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p298_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p298_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p298_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p298_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p298_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p298_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p298_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p298_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p298_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p298_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p298_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p298_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p298_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p298_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p298_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p298_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p298_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p298_025|it is bad news for the flooded areas.
p298_026|there will be widespread support on all sides.

p298_042|his charisma is all on the course.
p298_043|this is purely financial.
p298_044|i will not be in dialogue with her.
p298_045|our dispute is with the company not with the travelling public.
p298_046|i did not want any damage to us.
p298_047|it was an easy decision to come here.
p298_048|i didn't know the company all that well or the dancers.

p298_143|over the last four years we have been fairly consistent.
p298_144|that end is enjoying life as far as david is concerned.
p298_145|but clearly it is crucial to understand that point.

p298_227|it's been a long long journey.

p298_299|and he had much need.
p298_300|last night the bombardment was terrible.

p298_364|i'm looking at ways to do that now.
p298_365|that kind of growth is the important thing.

p299_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p299_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p299_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p299_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p299_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p299_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p299_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p299_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p299_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p299_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p299_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p299_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p299_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p299_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p299_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p299_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p299_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p299_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p299_025|i just went for it over the weekend.
p299_026|i managed to take her completely by surprise.
p299_027|it is only one night after all.
p299_028|gilbert was not amused.
p299_029|my first season in scotland was fantastic.
p299_030|i was left handed but it was just a matter of practice.
p299_031|it has moved on in the last week.
p299_032|it's easy to see why.
p299_033|i am proud of moments like that.
p299_034|this is a totally different order of agreement.
p299_035|nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p299_036|he was arrested but later released without charge.
p299_037|ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p299_038|this is a big advantage.
p299_039|i think we have a very strong case.
p299_040|we agreed to disagree.
p299_041|if you have to pay for treatment you pay for treatment.
p299_042|if you look at the beginning of alien.
p299_043|i've learned from my mistakes.
p299_044|today is not about contracts.
p299_045|it should be a great game though.
p299_046|that says something for his strength of character.
p299_047|you see it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p299_048|it's to do with play.
p299_049|usually you should leave it alone in the box.
p299_050|i've just got to do this.
p299_051|rangers will have a massive support in glasgow.
p299_052|that was the problem.
p299_053|ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p299_054|i have been here for only three months.
p299_055|everything else is second.
p299_056|i think it is a sensible change.
p299_057|sex is fun?
p299_058|they were not doing it too well either.
p299_059|he added it's not a racial problem.
p299_060|he had played well in that central role.
p299_061|we hope this scheme will change that.
p299_062|it was created by genocide.
p299_063|it was for me like a week in heaven.
p299_064|how could anyone take issue with that?
p299_065|he takes time out for everyone.
p299_066|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p299_067|now just two games into the season he has gone.
p299_068|a number of people could not speak english.
p299_069|they have got off with murder.
p299_070|they had had time for little else.
p299_071|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p299_072|we have reports of this throughout scotland.
p299_073|it probably didn't feel anything she added.
p299_074|the settlement could run to millions.
p299_075|it does not stop at the border.
p299_076|we've always had three options and none of them are perfect.
p299_077|how can they say that?
p299_078|robert is a special talent.
p299_079|john reid the northern ireland secretary yesterday appealed for restraint.
p299_080|she added it is a huge problem.
p299_081|you can't keep them separate.
p299_082|i still feel like a wee boy.
p299_083|he will be sentenced tomorrow by lord dawson.
p299_084|but there was a shift.
p299_085|israel has done very little until now.
p299_086|debate was impassioned and furious.
p299_087|we are losing this war.
p299_088|a decision is expected today.
p299_089|the death rates are still as high.
p299_090|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p299_091|there is a growing anger among the group.
p299_092|we certainly will need to watch him.
p299_093|i don't think it could be clearer.
p299_094|he put some colour into scottish history.
p299_095|our offer will remain on the table.
p299_096|we are trying to establish a date.
p299_097|he is a man who lives to work.
p299_098|the website is now being amended.
p299_099|it was a bit of a struggle today.
p299_100|if you could have dinner with anyone who would it be?
p299_101|it's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p299_102|this is thought to mean sometime next week.
p299_103|he had a heart problem.
p299_104|the breakdown was much later in her life.
p299_105|i tried to be cautious but it's hard in that role.
p299_106|that was the light relief.
p299_107|i am a wealthy person.
p299_108|he has one son and one daughter.
p299_109|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p299_110|that he claimed was essential.
p299_111|i have great respect for all my players.
p299_112|hopefully it will come from someone on our side.
p299_113|he had other things on his mind.
p299_114|i hadn't seen them in eight years.
p299_115|don hutchison too is a threat.
p299_116|the next few months will tell.
p299_117|it felt like my support system was leaving.
p299_118|it is crucial for both teams.
p299_119|i am happy with my form.
p299_120|you can see their point.
p299_121|council officials are involved along with the transport industry.
p299_122|they married in august last year.
p299_123|however in scotland this figure was four weeks.
p299_124|yet he chose to do something different.
p299_125|he was happy the bbc was happy the listeners were happy.
p299_126|there were no casualties.
p299_127|i've just got to build on this now.
p299_128|i was pleased with my own game.
p299_129|the case will now go to appeal.
p299_130|they really did a great job.
p299_131|a teacher is really about unity.
p299_132|where is the anthrax?
p299_133|bombing is the easy option.
p299_134|i love you so very much.
p299_135|lord johnston will give a decision later.
p299_136|the road was closed for several hours.
p299_137|they can be time consuming.
p299_138|in time may prove a worthy successor to billy dodds.
p299_139|i had a tie in my hand.
p299_140|a world away from rangers you might say.
p299_141|sean connery did not disappoint.
p299_142|such a city does not exist.
p299_143|my aim is a top six finish.
p299_144|we would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p299_145|this has a number of benefits.
p299_146|there is too much at stake for that.
p299_147|that is in the very nature of farming.
p299_148|these matters are now behind us.
p299_149|to which the only answer is don't hold your breath.
p299_150|thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p299_151|i love the tradition of vaudeville.
p299_152|it was then into overtime.
p299_153|most of the public are behind me.
p299_154|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p299_155|nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p299_156|i am still very much a director.
p299_157|i might have been sitting at home with her out here.
p299_158|but we are severely limited in funds.
p299_159|in some cases the nation should be grateful.
p299_160|meanwhile the problems of ball continue to multiply.
p299_161|my house was shaking at the time.
p299_162|they will know they deserve to be there.
p299_163|of course he is.
p299_164|this is a huge confidence boost.
p299_165|they recorded their debut album in new york.
p299_166|and does it?
p299_167|that's how it worked in bosnia.
p299_168|nobody even knew it had happened.
p299_169|freedom from serbia is a growing objective.
p299_170|she is a very lucky lady.
p299_171|was it a foul?
p299_172|jamming would be equally difficult.
p299_173|we've been there for seven years.
p299_174|he was as good as his word.
p299_175|promises were not kept.
p299_176|my life has been destroyed.
p299_177|his signature is his handwriting.
p299_178|he admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p299_179|the sense of excitement in stirling is tangible.
p299_180|it's not in my nature.
p299_181|you see this business is a good one.
p299_182|who is he?
p299_183|serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p299_184|our members are concerned about their futures.
p299_185|it was that bad that low.
p299_186|it also highlighted some local hero districts.
p299_187|the project is entitled the composer in scotland.
p299_188|it worked up to a point.
p299_189|there was no rescue.
p299_190|this isn't something the labour government has invented.
p299_191|i can't stand this sort of stuff.
p299_192|it's fun and challenging but it is not easy.
p299_193|now it is official barry ferguson is staying with rangers.
p299_194|is saddam a threat?
p299_195|we've got a great defensive club.
p299_196|darrell was however adamant.
p299_197|the rear of the plane was on fire.
p299_198|i feel privileged to be here.
p299_199|i'm not afraid of that.
p299_200|if they don't they might well decide not to play.
p299_201|she told me to apply for the crest.
p299_202|he explained to his audience.
p299_203|i think the government should pay for that.
p299_204|i never made any offer to mark.
p299_205|the actors are confident and polished.
p299_206|the budget was too low for that.
p299_207|all inquiries should be made to the police.
p299_208|i'm a bit annoyed.
p299_209|on that they agree.
p299_210|i just could not cope.
p299_211|the outcome is now in our own hands.
p299_212|it is all one sided.
p299_213|scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p299_214|here are some possible solutions.
p299_215|it was a thoroughly modern affair.
p299_216|they were both very brave.
p299_217|he made so many bad decisions.
p299_218|we are now up against it.
p299_219|it is anything but erotic but that is probably the point.
p299_220|i would have dropped out otherwise.
p299_221|she said no he's not in elgin today.
p299_222|nato would ensure they could return home he said.
p299_223|mrs anderson said this one was different.
p299_224|but the row refused to go away.
p299_225|our biggest threat is the bbc.
p299_226|bill is a mentor.
p299_227|they have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p299_228|this must be really short of ideas.
p299_229|i think he has undergone a sea change.
p299_230|i believe you may be that person.
p299_231|it was a big day.
p299_232|what makes a house a home?
p299_233|i think however he was having a fit
p299_234|at this stage we think the air campaign is enough.
p299_235|i will not be pressured.
p299_236|i had another good day.
p299_237|i hate the word.
p299_238|we should be trying to keep him in.
p299_239|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p299_240|i would say so.
p299_241|even for a british open this is different.
p299_242|i was the only one arguing differently.
p299_243|sub not used mckay.
p299_244|from a marketing standpoint you can understand their concern.
p299_245|mind you who wouldn't?
p299_246|that might happen in pakistan but in britain?
p299_247|the real ira was blamed for the blast.
p299_248|it was a tactical change.
p299_249|she had kept the news from him.
p299_250|when people talk about the beach boys and brian wilson.
p299_251|with this line up they didn't need to be.
p299_252|we have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p299_253|there are so many artists working in glasgow.
p299_254|one of these problems is the railways.
p299_255|before he left the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p299_256|we don't have the credible evidence.
p299_257|it's one up to the scots.
p299_258|i'm just doing artwork.
p299_259|he is a right bastard.
p299_260|i don't want to use the term.
p299_261|and we still have to pay his salary.
p299_262|also he was flawed.
p299_263|having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p299_264|so there's a double whammy.
p299_265|i didn't have a trio.
p299_266|their three other children had died as infants.
p299_267|we knew nothing about it.
p299_268|she is a great talent.
p299_269|i hope my successor will do the same.
p299_270|i learned that only yesterday.
p299_271|we do things in an appropriate way.
p299_272|i have been totally taken aback by this.
p299_273|are you in this movie?
p299_274|we have got a full house tonight.
p299_275|the things writers and directors say
p299_276|the fans will support us.
p299_277|is this new report the answer?
p299_278|it was a long process but we got there.
p299_279|it has however been a long time coming.
p299_280|we need to be looking to the future.
p299_281|the whole team was rubbish.
p299_282|but when he left the decision was forced upon us.
p299_283|some of the players have not progressed.
p299_284|it is quite an eye opener.
p299_285|you've got it coming kabul.
p299_286|they must act now to tighten the rules.
p299_287|quite simply no one else is willing to do so.
p299_288|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p299_289|but mainly it is up to ourselves.
p299_290|are his works inside out?
p299_291|there is a cup final at stake.
p299_292|it's the curse of our time irony.
p299_293|it was not a difficult decision he said.
p299_294|it's a source of deep concern.
p299_295|i am not a free trader.
p299_296|there were so many characters among them.
p299_297|it is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p299_298|however there are also many areas of agreement.
p299_299|last month he made his debut in japan.
p299_300|the dow jones is way up.
p299_301|now there's an even bigger target.
p299_302|they were the better side on the day.
p299_303|no decision on that was taken.
p299_304|what went wrong?
p299_305|there is nothing like a fresh start.
p299_306|they chose to side with terror.
p299_307|this must have been severe.
p299_308|we're all in a state of shock.
p299_309|i thought he was part of the camera.
p299_310|farmers have been an endangered species.
p299_311|we are in a learning curve.
p299_312|why should we have been asked to share?
p299_313|he was released in march this year.
p299_314|she was just that sort of person.
p299_315|surrey police said no body had been found.
p299_316|instead she just went away.
p299_317|i've seen some of the submissions.
p299_318|the palace said the queen was deeply saddened.
p299_319|it was chaotic and frightening.
p299_320|i think in three dimensions.
p299_321|it is a question of balance.
p299_322|soon the whole country will be level.
p299_323|he's very young but he is growing up.
p299_324|the chosen one doesn't always excel.
p299_325|i'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p299_326|lambert will be playing against belgium.
p299_327|we could not have asked for any more.
p299_328|eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p299_329|people might not actually want the job.
p299_330|it is the logical extension of audio description.
p299_331|his rival's are spoken with elan.
p299_332|the table was compiled by the daily telegraph.
p299_333|i have a bunch of veterans.
p299_334|i am not retiring.
p299_335|he also was in debt to drug dealers.
p299_336|the package has been properly costed.
p299_337|i can assure you the new augusta national is exactly that.
p299_338|we will work through the night.
p299_339|barry will be able to handle this.
p299_340|this is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p299_341|we just need the government to act.
p299_342|the urgency is real.
p299_343|the criminal justice system does not do that.
p299_344|he will never walk the streets again.
p299_345|we're very excited and challenged by the project.
p299_346|john anderson the former scottish national coach is still unearthing talent.
p299_347|the science is well known the solution is simple.
p299_348|they are just bewildered and very concerned.
p299_349|i can't stop people thinking.
p299_350|the workers said they were treated like animals.
p299_351|that's the last thing he will do.
p299_352|i have not been so angry for years.
p299_353|i am ready for that.
p299_354|do you mean today?
p299_355|this is normal for him now.
p299_356|but my heart is in athletics.
p299_357|nobody ever gets to see them.
p299_358|a review group will report on tuesday.
p299_359|yet he left a few days later.
p299_360|the place became a war zone.
p299_361|what's happening to her?
p299_362|it was to get even better for motherwell.
p299_363|both parties can win and scotland can win as a result.
p299_364|the surprise is its product is so poor.
p299_365|i don't have a new house.
p299_366|it's always nice to play on centre court.
p299_367|thus the story will continue to thrive.
p299_368|horses have some sense.
p299_369|the plot is minimal.
p299_370|see it while you can.
p299_371|the plane was in flames
p299_372|but then that really is the point.
p299_373|one policeman was killed.
p299_374|i didn't do too badly myself.
p299_375|their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p299_376|we have been working together for some years.
p299_377|chris paterson is a class act.
p299_378|he has never even been to ireland.
p299_379|and that's the question for the chamber.
p299_380|do what you have to do.
p299_381|i'm getting back up there now.
p299_382|we believe the squad will stay together.
p299_383|but clearly it is crucial to understand that point.
p299_384|there is a lot of anger.
p299_385|we suspect he was pleased.
p299_386|it was meant to rival the dollar.
p299_387|mary is as it were the cause of her mother's death.
p299_388|she always wanted her own way.
p299_389|maybe who knows?
p299_390|and the funny thing is they usually do.
p299_391|everything is surrounded by confusion.
p299_392|it was a sell out.
p299_393|we welcome the proposals but they must get on with it.
p299_394|if there is default.
p299_395|she can't say where she was what she did.
p299_396|i'll take what comes along.
p299_397|jack mcconnell is the obvious choice.
p299_398|she will just have wanted her baby.
p299_399|scotland is losing business.
p299_400|we are working on the two things.
p299_401|we only lost the third goal.
p299_402|women reported more depression than men.
p299_403|we will have to see but it makes you think.
p299_404|the euro is your money it is our money.
p299_405|nothing has been going for us but what can you do?
p300_001|please call stella.
p300_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p300_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p300_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p300_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p300_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p300_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p300_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p300_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p300_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p300_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p300_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p300_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p300_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p300_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
p300_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p300_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p300_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p300_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p300_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p300_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p300_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p300_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p300_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p300_025|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p300_026|this is not a floating las vegas.
p300_027|it is not an amnesty.
p300_028|the important thing was to be there and to experience it.
p300_029|of course this is nice to hear.
p300_030|it was between myself the management and the team.

p300_032|the music industry hasn't changed at all.
p300_033|there will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p300_034|blood samples have been taken.
p300_035|someone came down and said can you read a script?
p300_036|he said he now intends to fly today.
p300_037|this means that our programme is quite unusual.
p300_038|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p300_039|a further police inquiry is currently being held.
p300_040|some people begin to turn away to go home.
p300_041|you're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p300_042|a recording contract is on the horizon.
p300_043|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p300_044|we like being the underdogs.
p300_045|they said construction work could begin within weeks.
p300_046|we will continue to operate within the sport.
p300_047|but the law is very clear on this.
p300_048|but all forms of the illness are treatable.
p300_049|it is also central to the unfolding drama.
p300_050|except for this it was offside.
p300_051|on the contrary some of the music is very expensive.
p300_052|it's a grey area.
p300_053|retirement who knows?
p300_054|he was shocked by what he saw.
p300_055|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p300_056|it comes on like a tidal wave.
p300_057|england and wales are likely to pull out.
p300_058|mr cook a left winger from britain would be ideally placed.
p300_059|he was taken ill in december last year.
p300_060|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p300_061|it's all too short term.
p300_062|this he told the committee was not forthcoming.
p300_063|meanwhile the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p300_064|robin williams is very subdued.
p300_065|his rival's are spoken with elan.
p300_066|he also does not get along with christina.
p300_067|if convicted they face the death penalty.
p300_068|how things have changed since then.
p300_069|therefore it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p300_070|this is the way things should be handled.
p300_071|for me the tour is wide open this year.
p300_072|in the past few years they have started to fight back.

p300_079|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p300_080|the table was compiled by the daily telegraph.
p300_081|his options are severely limited.
p300_082|this is truly field of miracles.
p300_083|they are not an item.
p300_084|why did they let him go?

p300_090|what happens when the funding is exhausted.
p300_091|he then had a swipe at hearts.
p300_092|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p300_093|but the relief was short lived.
p300_094|you had better believe it.
p300_095|the mood is upbeat.
p300_096|he told us about it the next day.
p300_097|it's not a new concept in jazz.
p300_098|there are a huge number of arts.
p300_099|they are therefore not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.

p300_102|where is the anthrax?
p300_103|housing is in very short supply.
p300_104|after all he is the king of scotland.
p300_105|people just came on their own.
p300_106|we are so so lucky so many people have died.
p300_107|the culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p300_108|you either have him or you don't.
p300_109|there are some new buildings in there.
p300_110|i am prepared to step down.
p300_111|i'm not a diva.
p300_112|there is great relief at this point.

p300_120|however it very nearly all went wrong.
p300_121|it is not a definite proposal as yet.
p300_122|i will speak to michael about this.
p300_123|this is not understood by people outside.
p300_124|i'm sure this game will be equally successful.

p300_133|we haven't actually considered it down here.
p300_134|there is still much work to be done.
p300_135|however details have yet to be worked out.
p300_136|all our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p300_137|one of them a woman is in serious condition.
p300_138|we were with him the whole time.
p300_139|from then on scott has never looked back.
p300_140|all manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p300_141|that's because we work hard at it.
p300_142|this might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p300_143|he's been the key to everything.
p300_144|since then my life has been turned upside down.
p300_145|headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p300_146|they said to me why don't you get into acting tommy?
p300_147|we need a new kind of theatre.
p300_148|i was in the train station overnight.
p300_149|i feel my life to be at risk.
p300_150|again and again at every level he delivered the goods.
p300_151|that would be poetic wouldn't it?
p300_152|we came across the first set of bodies.
p300_153|we need some confidence to get a win.
p300_154|does that put pressure on us?
p300_156|this is a foolish idea.
p300_157|you might even have seen him.
p300_158|sussex police refused to give any further details.
p300_159|they thought they had found a home.
p300_160|she collapsed and died a day later.

p300_176|it is very difficult to find a buyer.
p300_177|it shows that we are civilised society.
p300_178|it's a commission and it's for work a year's work.
p300_179|i came home by ambulance.

p300_181|this was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p300_182|she is living proof of their expertise.

p300_203|it's hard but if we don't do it nobody will.
p300_204|donald was a man with many friends.
p300_205|we played them off the pitch.
p300_206|it is turning that way all across europe.
p300_207|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p300_208|we were on top and could've won.
p300_209|that night was a terrible muddle.
p300_210|the next time he saw her she was a different person.
p300_211|he ended up a headmaster.
p300_212|he was too good for me too consistent.
p300_213|it is like being a qualifier again.
p300_214|david murray the rangers chairman also welcomed the scheme.
p300_215|if we live forever can we really be said to live?
p300_216|jimmy returned to aberdeen but she remained with george.

p300_218|roy keane is certainly the best.
p300_219|i might get an injury very easily.
p300_220|there are a lot of unanswered questions.
p300_221|a world away from rangers you might say.
p300_222|that was a stunning drive from jon.
p300_223|she didn't tell us anything new.
p300_224|there is nothing like this back home.
p300_225|and that gives a kind of freedom.
p300_226|i found a fault and it worked at it.
p300_227|it was a poor performance.
p300_228|they may yet have the last laugh.
p300_229|you can feel at home in china.
p300_230|this is all part of opening the door.
p300_231|we have tried to keep his head up.
p300_232|for the other parties it is back to business as usual.
p300_233|he will become the sovereign.

p300_235|everyone could see it apart from kevin keegan.
p300_236|the success story shows no signs of stopping.
p300_237|this is a huge boost for my confidence.
p300_238|it is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p300_239|it's just gotten too big.
p300_240|was all this really just five months ago?
p300_241|the property is owned by glasgow city council.
p300_242|they were two different types.
p300_243|it need not be like that.
p300_244|at that time there was no infection within five miles.
p300_245|their findings are published in the journal injury prevention.
p300_246|around the building the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p300_247|the performance for this listener didn't come off.
p300_248|however bbc scotland was not interested in his work.
p300_249|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p300_250|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p300_251|i am totally horrified by the sentence.
p300_252|i just saw them for a few minutes.
p300_253|a management agreement however was conceded.
p300_254|people would say he thinks he can do that as well.
p300_255|the site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p300_256|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p300_257|two things will count for us in brussels.
p300_258|today's meeting was open and friendly.
p300_259|it is the stop gap before extinction.
p300_260|he must have something up his sleeve.
p300_261|if it wasn't so pathetic it would be funny.
p300_262|they failed in their duty to mr logan.
p300_263|that means no more taxation by stealth.
p300_264|history may repeat itself with billy elliot.
p300_265|holland won by five wickets.
p300_266|his expulsion would not solve the problem.
p300_267|after day one back he may be revising that opinion already.
p300_268|once they go away they won't come back.
p300_269|the best marriages are made in heaven.
p300_270|the main thing is that they enjoy it.

p300_272|we have to sort it out ourselves.
p300_273|the board has rejected her proposals.
p300_274|it does not move which is amazing.
p300_275|she is a very lucky young lady.
p300_276|the threat to rural areas is real.
p300_277|tourism continues to struggle.
p300_278|that however can only be achieved by constant investment.
p300_279|but in the end he did and blew him away.
p300_280|the us is a diverse and colourful nation.
p300_281|this is a great shame.
p300_282|that was merely their initial problem.
p300_283|i'm going to help out in the summer as producer.
p300_284|we said what do you mean?
p300_285|i need them to set my career.
p300_286|the law will take its course.
p300_287|they don't know each other but they have made this commitment.
p300_288|it puts the thought out for other people to think about.
p300_289|the fund has three elements.
p300_290|this is still a young team you know.
p300_291|it's not even finished.
p300_292|everyone knew where they were.
p300_293|as agreed the prime minister was driven to westminster hall.
p300_294|in the old days it was easy.
p300_295|people will make up their own minds.
p300_296|after that he became more romantic.
p300_297|there is bound to be a formal complaint.
p300_298|my view has now completely changed.
p300_299|they finished second and third.
p300_300|we agreed to disagree.
p300_301|he was then replaced by ross.
p300_302|it had not been a terribly inspiring end either.
p300_303|i'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p300_304|we've always had three options and none of them are perfect.
p300_305|people can get them if they want.
p300_306|their message was simple.
p300_307|they are currently managed by ian wilson.
p300_308|he is a law unto himself.
p300_309|with him are the symbols of his faith.
p300_310|there are no easy solutions to this problem.
p300_311|an aide was constructed to get a copy.
p300_312|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p300_313|part of johnny was found some days after.
p300_314|it is just completely erased.
p300_315|a great deal has been achieved.
p300_316|i've been thinking about it for a year.
p300_317|i enjoy playing with both of them.
p300_318|too often it is not.
p300_319|i tend not to look back.
p300_320|confidence among the allies began to slip.
p300_321|i got a yellow card.
p300_322|technically it was a very good performance by scotland.
p300_323|i don't know what he was capable of.
p300_324|our place as artists is to ask questions.
p300_325|it's good to start with judith.
p300_326|she is now on the back benches.
p300_327|it may also be her last.
p300_328|maybe it helps us.
p300_329|three bystanders were killed.
p300_330|she should savour this because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p300_331|however within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p300_332|he made no big mistakes.
p300_333|there has been no cover up just the opposite in fact.
p300_334|we will be homeless.
p300_335|i believe he can do a better job.
p300_336|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p300_337|instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p300_338|that decision was applauded by williamson.
p300_339|but their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p300_340|well was it?
p300_341|we won't let you down.
p300_342|what kind of person is he?
p300_343|does it work is it safe and is it right?
p300_344|he was visited by uk consular officials.
p300_345|so we shall remain vigilant and keep the pressure on him.
p300_346|english is the language of pop music.
p300_347|the israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p300_348|it is a simple equation.
p300_349|she has seen or heard it all.
p300_350|which scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p300_351|this time however there is a new venue.
p300_352|who has the second highest?
p300_354|you can leave him knowing the job will be done.
p300_355|i didn't even have the first idea.
p300_356|no person was charged.
p300_357|i've only met him three times.
p300_358|you see my back has gone.
p300_359|it's a logical consequence of the formula.
p300_360|she looked very very poor.
p300_361|nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p300_362|butcher has only one idea in mind.
p300_363|this is not great but it goes well.
p300_364|it's an hour of the same response.
p300_365|both are national treasures.
p300_366|and here is the rub.
p300_367|they are also exploited by the markets.
p300_368|stewart will travel with some confidence.
p300_369|i am really looking forward to it.
p300_370|i think at last the company will find itself again.
p300_371|this takes the pressure off.
p300_372|if he saw somebody in trouble he would try to help.
p300_373|i will never get over his death.
p300_374|my husband was born in zimbabwe.
p300_375|we were very happy with our results which were excellent.
p300_376|the mix with tiger is perfect.
p300_377|well it happened to me so it's happening to him.
p300_378|off duty nurses were called in at ayr.
p300_379|they should have some measure of protection.
p300_380|they did not threaten anyone.
p300_381|who is going to pay their wages?
p300_382|there is no hiding place in it no room for passengers.
p300_383|even then he was in the media spotlight.
p300_384|but this is not just a tibetan issue.
p300_385|that's the kind of thing that counts.
p300_386|construction would then begin.
p300_387|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p300_388|a century on little has changed.
p300_389|it is a temptation which should be resisted.
p300_390|certainly in terms of league position we must be favourites.
p300_391|form and structure are his music.
p300_392|i don't have any bitterness about it it's just a fact.
p300_393|is the welsh assembly going to go?

p301_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p301_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p301_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p301_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p301_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p301_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p301_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p301_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p301_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p301_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p301_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p301_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p301_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p301_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p301_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p301_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p301_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p301_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p301_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p301_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p301_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p301_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p301_025|but it was a great decision he joked.
p301_026|they changed the world of music.
p301_027|you need a long term strategy in football.
p301_028|the law has got to be upheld.
p301_029|but we're not the same person.
p301_030|he had just returned to thailand from canada.
p301_031|i saw the explosion and panicked.
p301_032|the punishment was swift.
p301_033|however there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p301_034|i kept my side of the bargain.
p301_035|it also makes for interesting viewing.
p301_036|jacques chirac the french president was surely in his sights.
p301_037|he released a half dozen solo albums.
p301_038|that respect is missing in the netherlands.
p301_039|there's always a solution somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p301_040|hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p301_041|it doesn't make them evil.
p301_042|i have played really well all year.
p301_043|parts of the system are already overstretched.
p301_044|tourism in scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p301_045|it's like if he's all right we will go with him.
p301_046|she added it is the same story in both countries.
p301_047|lara is very very much a girl.
p301_048|i try not to expect anything.
p301_049|lord sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p301_050|there will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p301_051|it was however the wrong side.
p301_052|she is now planning a visit.
p301_053|it also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p301_054|here he is in effect appointing himself a judge.
p301_055|today we begin to answer that question.
p301_056|no it wasn't supposed to do that officials admitted.
p301_057|i keep my fingers crossed.
p301_058|the encounter was to change his life.
p301_059|it's the best of both worlds.
p301_060|they have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p301_061|that is why we want this decision reversed.
p301_062|it didn't work against sweden but that was the intention.
p301_063|staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p301_064|we tried everything but it just wasn't to be today.
p301_065|after this the exercise was due to begin.
p301_066|and she doesn't feel like annika is better.
p301_067|i want my country to be a republic not an empire.
p301_068|celtic connections is here again and the great debate.
p301_069|i'm just feeling very tired but it's great.
p301_070|when he took over it really took off.
p301_071|that's just the way the game is evolving.
p301_072|michael is putting on a brave face.
p301_073|hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p301_074|the next thing will be cutting journey times.
p301_075|it's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p301_076|this is a mental challenge.
p301_077|their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p301_078|he accused the prime minister of dithering.
p301_079|without approval the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p301_080|ferguson did not hesitate.
p301_081|he came in an army uniform.
p301_082|however within those figures income from overseas visitors increased.
p301_083|cars are great for going long distances.
p301_084|it was published yesterday on the internet.
p301_085|i knew he would play two weeks ago.
p301_086|the general secretary represents a new era in labour party politics.
p301_087|it has never been worthwhile.
p301_088|so other options had to be explored.
p301_089|he is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p301_090|we will learn lessons from what has happened.
p301_091|people love to see this stuff.
p301_092|one film a year is he says his natural rhythm.
p301_093|three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p301_094|his female companion was being treated for shock.
p301_095|i have no plans to change the oath.
p301_096|we did not even get a free kick.
p301_097|he was married with a young child.
p301_098|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p301_099|anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p301_100|they serve a multitude of purposes.
p301_101|but his attendance is not guaranteed.
p301_102|i am sure all schools would accept that.
p301_103|i am very sorry to be here.
p301_104|i needed a change a new challenge.
p301_105|is your life a little too easy?
p301_106|i think my game is suited to grass.
p301_107|the little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p301_108|industry leaders reacted angrily.
p301_109|europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p301_110|people want to see me on the screen.
p301_111|the labour party's not downbeat and neither is the labour government.
p301_112|and that is our first victory in edinburgh.
p301_113|the conversion didn't go over either.
p301_114|he took away my childhood.
p301_115|they hoped to remain in the edinburgh area.
p301_116|the motive for the shooting was not known.
p301_117|since then they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p301_118|serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p301_119|it is not great art.
p301_120|you do not change overnight.
p301_121|the way they play it is hard to score against them.
p301_122|one the acute services trust will run the general hospital services.
p301_123|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p301_124|we all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p301_125|we aim to put them out of business.
p301_126|tony blair should get out more.
p301_127|we didn't enjoy the first game but today they were excellent.
p301_128|he was just awesome.
p301_129|we now have to concentrate on the league.
p301_130|we need to move forward together.
p301_131|she died in hospital two hours later.
p301_132|she was making a living but her career was going nowhere.
p301_133|both were later released after a check up.
p301_134|no one however was complacent about the size of the task.
p301_135|how good is lennox lewis?
p301_136|i would ask the fans to be patient.
p301_137|the ethos of the school was outstanding.
p301_138|the son has autism and other problems.
p301_139|i'm very puzzled by it.
p301_140|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p301_141|volvo is grateful to its staff in irvine.
p301_142|we are both very confused and extremely angry.
p301_143|all things are possible if you believe.
p301_144|this was not just incongruous.
p301_145|it is patently true.
p301_146|you hope he prevails.
p301_147|and a mightily impressive recording it is too.
p301_148|the fellowship is much more than a commission he said.
p301_149|what the department of transport will make clear.
p301_150|but it looks good for next year.
p301_151|i haven't just gone in done a three hour rehearsal and gone.
p301_152|he is wanted by german police for questioning.
p301_153|he was forced to quit.
p301_154|it is good for their eyesight.
p301_155|i was loving that little girl.
p301_156|but you can't have it both ways.
p301_157|we don't just play golf in scotland.
p301_158|that's why the young musicians have joined.
p301_159|the death toll included five children.
p301_160|before the game we went for a pint.
p301_161|there is no credible official announcement.
p301_162|i understand the medical concerns.
p301_163|this is a united kingdom.
p301_164|i thought it was a fantastic game.
p301_165|i am aware that somebody made a threat.
p301_166|however who could have predicted this result?
p301_167|shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p301_168|as long as it is possible we will keep going.
p301_169|they were behind the wheel.
p301_170|the pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p301_171|the problem arises because he does so much.
p301_172|the answer is mayhem.
p301_173|our young people are leaving.
p301_174|what then is the real thing?
p301_175|i can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p301_176|that will be the sweetness.
p301_177|but is it ethical to practice in humans?
p301_178|the big issue for us is the review.
p301_179|there was a fossil on screen.
p301_180|i always loved the lightning in the movies.
p301_181|this does not create any precedent.
p301_182|i see social work as a vocation a commitment.
p301_183|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p301_184|i'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p301_185|you can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p301_186|the early evidence suggests he did not.
p301_187|ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p301_188|i hope you miss the cut.
p301_189|the role was perfect for russell.
p301_190|morale is very high despite the growing risks.
p301_191|we are seeking funds from government departments.
p301_192|that though was again according to manager mccall.
p301_193|he scored one goal and was on fire.
p301_194|i hate to say it but you can understand it.
p301_195|harold is a rarity.
p301_196|walk out the door and anything can happen.
p301_197|i want him to take on gomez.
p301_198|her condition last night was described as critical.
p301_199|frankly it was worth the booking.
p301_200|they tend to be easily influenced by others.
p301_201|well what do you know?
p301_202|there are some serious ethical issues involved.
p301_203|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p301_204|europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p301_205|he will emerge as a world leader.
p301_206|it opens the door to the champions league.
p301_207|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p301_208|we have no choice but to shut down.
p301_209|the prognosis is excellent.
p301_210|they always want to give a performance.
p301_211|but he just carried on anyway.
p301_212|iain duncan smith is wrong.
p301_213|i would not want to be young again.
p301_214|meanwhile the search continues for ferguson's replacement.
p301_215|the yugoslav army will still be there.
p301_216|there are schoolboys in uniform.
p301_217|they were later discharged from hospital.
p301_218|these findings would be made public.
p301_219|what are you not good at?
p301_220|all the lads are totally focused on that.
p301_221|he added later normally it's not a dangerous river.
p301_222|this makes no sense
p301_223|i go home only once.
p301_224|it had a gigantic effect.
p301_225|i like many others will consider where we go from here.
p301_226|if not a deal could take many months.
p301_227|the team this year is going places.
p301_228|more money for students would help in an ideal world.
p301_229|it took more than two years.
p301_230|sullivan was later charged with her murder which she denied.
p301_231|he said because people had invited him.
p301_232|that's the key issue isn't it?
p301_233|its workforce is to be made redundant.
p301_234|hopefully it will pay off for me.
p301_235|correction knowing him he might.
p301_236|i came up through the ranks.
p301_237|why does she suddenly win everything now?
p301_238|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p301_239|these guys will not lie down.
p301_240|the tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p301_241|that is nearly four people every day.
p301_242|there are nine people here now.
p301_243|his son is a local legend.
p301_244|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p301_245|which perhaps is just as well.
p301_246|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p301_247|he would just say it was terrible.
p301_248|this is the new edinburgh.
p301_249|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p301_250|i hope it has helped the prisoners.
p301_251|we kept going right to the final whistle.
p301_252|for sure you won't know unless you ask him.
p301_253|john anderson the former scottish national coach is still unearthing talent.
p301_254|the final stage is paranoia.
p301_255|i am not holding the club to ransom.
p301_256|wagner was never like this.
p301_257|pig farmers are completely despondent.
p301_258|but they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p301_259|we would love for him to stay but he's going home.
p301_260|that's the sort of game you want.
p301_261|we're not travel agents.
p301_262|scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p301_263|we are trying to clarify the issues.
p301_264|it's the same old story.
p301_265|he was telling me to keep quiet.
p301_266|it was a moment of madness.
p301_267|i do not own the vessel in question.
p301_268|racism has no place in any sport.
p301_269|i am not happy with proposals for widows.
p301_270|it is believed she had serious head injuries.
p301_271|bombing is the easy option.
p301_272|drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p301_273|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p301_274|the pilot was making a visual approach.
p301_275|i'd say we should give it a week.
p301_276|many other scottish locations also feature.
p301_277|little voice is on general release.
p301_278|that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p301_279|there is no substitute.
p301_280|that nation is south africa.
p301_281|this will secure the future of our industry.
p301_282|the police have an awful lot to explain.
p301_283|wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p301_284|that's when you hope to take advantage.
p301_285|it was an empowering journey.
p301_286|the board would report to the scottish parliament.
p301_287|it's not unlike the millennium bug.
p301_288|they had been together for about three years.
p301_289|children are using books in a terrible condition.
p301_290|everything has been destroyed.
p301_291|the painting was started but finishing it was quite another matter.
p301_292|he is married with one daughter and lives in kent.
p301_293|we just want to get stuck in now.
p301_294|do you come from moscow?
p301_295|broomfield was the centre of the town.
p301_296|he or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p301_297|they are the innocent victims.
p301_298|we are aware of the tribunal case.
p301_299|that is the first job of the director leadership.
p301_300|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p301_301|but he was a full working member of our staff.
p301_302|broke the birdie record.
p301_303|either group is living in fantasy land.
p301_304|they tried to give her advice.
p301_305|that it is a brand name.
p301_306|we're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p301_307|another casualty yesterday was john prescott.
p301_308|they will have to make changes.
p301_309|this fact is supported by audience research.
p301_310|of further privacy he had no need.
p301_311|both sides have to step back.
p301_312|lord johnston will give a decision later.
p301_313|they scored a goal but we have to keep playing.
p301_314|it sounds a bit of an own goal.
p301_315|we are ready for the long haul.
p301_316|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p301_317|i look for dancers who are also actors.
p301_318|however civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p301_319|emi is a prime example.
p301_320|i'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p301_321|the observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p301_322|it's a record label not a form of music.
p301_323|not that agassi was a believer.
p301_324|a friendship that will endure.
p301_325|tourism is a vital industry for scotland.
p301_326|it needs to be sorted out by easter.
p301_327|nowadays it is workers united.
p301_328|he is young but not too young.
p301_329|i played well on saturday and again today.
p301_330|it will also take evidence from consumers.
p301_331|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p301_332|i am not obsessed with sex.
p301_333|they've been at it for five hours.
p301_334|there is no answer to it.
p301_335|there was no let up for the minnows.
p301_336|birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p301_337|his english counterpart agreed.
p301_338|it was frightening intense and primal theatre.
p301_339|he wasn't really doing anything so he wanted out.
p301_340|anyway she is playing a lesbian.
p301_341|i am not putting myself down.
p301_342|he's a joy to follow.
p301_343|bob dylan is getting old.
p301_344|we were lucky to have survived.
p301_345|maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p301_346|at this level you have all to perform well.
p301_347|i just want to change my life.
p301_348|he did not oppose the divorce.
p301_349|connell was standing there ordering her to get up.
p301_350|and michael was just great.
p301_351|he knew it would cost him millions.
p301_352|law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p301_353|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p301_354|clearly she says she would never resort to such devices.
p301_355|that only came out during a radio interview.
p301_356|we are now setting about finding them.
p301_357|they were the best team but unlucky in the end.
p301_358|we must not go down that road.
p301_359|it won't happen overnight but things will get better.
p301_360|i am not among its admirers.
p301_361|and that match was played in june.
p301_362|he will address the nation this evening.
p301_363|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p301_364|i couldn't really work outside edinburgh.
p301_365|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p301_366|but he is revelling in the big stage.
p301_367|stock markets will be watching closely.
p301_368|if they have city backing what is the influence?
p301_369|moving from manchester to london was upheaval enough.
p301_370|mr straw was home secretary at the time.
p301_371|there is no magical figure but there are criteria.
p301_372|his job was not advertised.
p301_373|and the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p301_374|scottish life can be like this too.
p301_375|he has changed my life for ever.
p301_376|the home was now under new management.
p301_377|it is like a theatre of the absurd.
p301_378|there is no openness.
p301_379|it's being very carefully looked at.
p301_380|it was a job he loved.
p301_381|it may encourage more people to prospect.
p301_382|filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p301_383|where was their passion the power the feeling?
p301_384|it looks like paradise.
p301_385|at the moment it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p301_386|we were short of athletes.
p301_387|they want to avoid a flashpoint.
p301_388|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p301_389|the wealth of talent in australia is awesome.
p301_390|even though the show is seriously exacting physically demanding.
p301_391|i had no qualms about it.
p301_392|muslim leaders in italy have denied the charge.
p301_393|mcmaster had already seen the first part.
p301_394|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p301_395|we have been working closely with holyrood.
p301_396|it was early morning.
p301_397|partition is not an option.
p301_398|what other retailer would do this?
p301_399|this is usually done by the space shuttle.
p301_400|anyway even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p301_401|i won't go back to holland.
p301_402|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p301_403|there was no cohesion.
p301_404|he is very popular in the squad in england and abroad.
p301_405|whether this return was too soon.
p301_406|jackson may well be right.
p301_407|my thoughts are with their families.
p301_408|i saw some good things.
p301_409|princess margaret is being buried on that day.
p301_410|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p301_411|still the experience was amazing she says.
p302_001|please call stella.
p302_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p302_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p302_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p302_005|she can spoon these things into her three bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.

p303_123|in that case we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p303_124|john reid the scottish secretary also welcomed the news.

p303_144|that end is enjoying life as far as david is concerned.
p303_145|but clearly it is crucial to understand that point.

p303_155|except this time it seems he really really means it.

p303_171|it's just that we see different things.

p303_202|i am not a happy man.
p303_203|you can be sure we will have problems.
p303_204|sometimes you get them sometimes you don't.
p303_205|i'm going with all three.
p303_206|most of them were one year conscripts.
p303_207|the line up is a tasty one.
p303_208|i don't honestly know how to describe it.
p303_209|he wins the match with a passionate committed almost demented display.
p303_210|he had taken everything from me.
p303_211|many many people don't know who he is.
p303_212|suspension will come into force at midnight.
p303_213|they should also have the right to vote.
p303_214|all the teachers are afghan refugees.
p303_215|what's in a name in this the age of the internet?
p303_216|people are so negative about the whole business.
p303_217|they had given up on him.
p303_218|we didn't know if people would turn up.
p303_219|it has made me feel good.
p303_220|you know he was struggling with his game all week.
p303_221|we have our supporters and our enemies.
p303_222|she has now been registered as disabled.
p303_223|now however it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p303_224|i was living with my mum.
p303_225|it did my image a lot of good
p303_226|this government believes in parental discipline.
p303_227|it's been a long long journey.
p303_228|that will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p303_229|but there has never been the time she said.
p303_230|this could be one such case he declared.
p303_231|i fell in love with ballet.
p303_232|the merger was welcomed by tony blair.
p303_233|mr king who was present at yesterday's hearing refused to comment.
p303_234|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p303_235|i spoke with just one player but not the others.
p303_236|we're still talking with a few people.
p303_237|but one shouldn't go by that.
p303_238|nothing is lost everything is recycled.
p303_239|i think in three dimensions.
p303_240|they had four children together.
p303_241|thames valley police decided not to prosecute.
p303_242|alcohol of course is strictly forbidden in iran.

p303_244|all were later allowed home.
p303_245|she has a wonderful mind.
p303_246|there are just two tournaments remaining.
p303_247|we're into that build up now.
p303_248|it is the end of an era.
p303_249|we can just get on with our game.
p303_250|but first it goes out on tv.
p303_251|we're trying to lessen the stigma.
p303_252|sub not used mckenzie.
p303_253|both will be heard at glasgow sheriff court.
p303_254|i learned a lot from her.
p303_255|we have reacted well to each other.
p303_256|partly but only partly this is their own fault.
p303_257|they seem to be backing off from that.
p303_258|they have a very good method of working.
p303_259|do you think you have a shot?
p303_260|i believe we have a good chance.
p303_261|things were not easy from the outset.
p303_262|she may even appear in some more films.
p303_263|we've had great things in the past.
p303_264|our idea is to make it entirely irish.
p303_265|i've seen some of the submissions.
p303_266|there is no such thing.
p303_267|i feel very strongly about that.
p303_268|it is a difficult thing to explain.
p303_269|after that nothing could save him.
p303_270|his treatment has been quite atrocious.
p303_271|it wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p303_272|sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p303_273|it is now very clear that that doesn't work.
p303_274|my dad was working in ayrshire.
p303_275|there are lots of these women in finland.
p303_276|drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p303_277|last year however was a different story.
p303_278|he is a close friend of gordon brown.
p303_279|i bought a car at auction.
p303_280|and who were they anyway beforehand?
p303_281|what is the working families tax credit?
p303_282|she had been sexually assaulted.
p303_283|meanwhile rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p303_284|alcohol and nicotine are now no go areas.
p303_285|they are so easy for youngsters to open.
p303_286|we have been treated with complete contempt.
p303_287|there is no smoking gun.
p303_288|it was rather a distorted image of islam.
p303_289|mr blair was in washington a week later.
p303_290|if glasgow is so interested they have the right to bid.
p303_291|the pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p303_292|i have been coming here for nine years.
p303_293|i felt under no pressure today.
p303_294|the devil is the creator of weapons.
p303_295|and that was the adults.
p303_296|last night however other experts were cautious about the claim.
p303_297|that is a job for the government.
p303_298|i felt the head was very like me.
p303_299|and he had much need.
p303_300|last night the bombardment was terrible.
p303_301|this can only help us go forward.
p303_302|that left a bad taste in my mouth.
p303_304|andrew mclellan is no exception.
p303_305|his arguments were supported by mr bevan.
p303_306|some have other commitments.
p303_307|last week he was taken into hospital.
p303_308|he moved back to edinburgh where he lived with his mother.
p303_309|no one not even the scottish arts council was interested in her.
p303_310|the crowd was awesome.
p303_311|that was moving the goalposts.
p303_312|we have the location which is assured.
p303_313|rapid revision was required.
p303_314|what if the confession is after all a fake?
p303_315|we couldn't go very fast.
p303_316|tony blair can you see her face?
p303_317|everything will fall into place it should be fine.
p303_318|we have grown up in britain.
p303_319|they had previously been on five day notice.
p303_320|i am proud of those guys.
p303_321|it's been very exciting very challenging and a privilege.
p303_322|it is too early to speculate.
p303_323|she is however fully conscious and able to speak.
p303_324|i'll go out and be aggressive.
p303_325|i wanted really to deal with two opposite energies.
p303_326|what is the truth about the cow?
p303_327|they will want to watch a winning team.
p303_328|who is going to be penalised?
p303_329|i feel sorry for the reds.
p303_330|the government however insists the company is not for sale.
p303_331|just see where the blood is coming from.
p303_332|i have a theory.
p303_333|in her opinion the rich are different.
p303_334|hopefully the whole of scottish rugby was paying attention.
p303_335|last year it was ligaments in his knee.
p303_336|thankfully we have started to listen to our customers.
p303_337|sentence was deferred for background reports.
p303_338|i'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p303_339|some of his family still live there.
p303_340|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p303_341|dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p303_342|i get to work with very good people.
p303_343|a quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p303_344|obviously someone is not doing their job properly.
p303_345|and we know that because we know the hairdresser.
p303_346|i can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p303_347|on this showing they should stick with the lads.
p303_348|i can appear to be nice and lovely.
p303_349|i don't think the saudis will lay down.
p303_350|people tended to stay there for some time.
p303_351|an internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p303_352|my preference is for the single vaccines.
p303_353|this represents a tough game for us.
p304_001|please call stella.
p304_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p304_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p304_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p304_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p304_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p304_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p304_008|these take the shape of a long round arc with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p304_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p304_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p304_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p304_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p304_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p304_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p304_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p304_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p304_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p304_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p304_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p304_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p304_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p304_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p304_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p304_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p304_025|so we will cut their numbers.
p304_026|who cares about that?
p304_027|sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p304_028|glasgow is going to be open for business.
p304_029|i know my job.
p304_030|the likelihood is that it will be negative.
p304_031|in fact we were all over the shop.
p304_032|scottish rugby has given me everything.
p304_033|they agree to meet.
p304_034|sometimes it's not what you say that counts.
p304_035|but there was a heavy price to pay.
p304_036|the most important thing was to win today.
p304_037|we have a strong team at the moment.
p304_038|at half time you have?
p304_039|the butcher is very good.
p304_040|he is dying from cancer.
p304_041|however they will only be found in the wild.
p304_042|it was an ambush.
p304_043|for these people the ruling is very welcome.
p304_044|scottish sport was not mentioned.
p304_045|i was doing a charity concert.
p304_046|you have to have a sense of humour.
p304_047|it is not about changing our image.
p304_048|we are waiting for advice on the film.
p304_049|i hadn't been looking after myself.
p304_050|his father said my son was lucky.
p304_051|but they also came with a downside.
p304_052|she was only doing her job.
p304_053|are you listening all saints?
p304_054|and then came the seventies.
p304_055|i guess it is down to focus.
p304_056|i'm very angry about it.
p304_057|i have great respect for all my players.
p304_058|his track record is not promising.
p304_059|for a moment it was all about her.
p304_060|sadly the game will never see his like again.
p304_061|trading places was too obvious.
p304_062|they don't know how to do it.
p304_063|no details were disclosed.
p304_064|mrs anderson said this one was different.
p304_065|if you can get away with it you do it.
p304_066|first is open defiance.
p304_067|you probably have never seen them before.
p304_068|clearly audiences are unsettled.
p304_069|we have avoided that at least.
p304_070|i love a clever reader.
p304_071|i do not believe they are.
p304_072|that is completely against islam.
p304_073|clearly there will have to be changes.
p304_074|smuggling is an increasing problem for the government.
p304_075|i will wait until later.
p304_076|but of course it isn't.
p304_077|we are almost at that point but not quite.
p304_078|whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p304_079|could it be?
p304_080|it is bad news for us and england.
p304_081|they had failed to explode.
p304_082|we're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p304_083|i am happy to play for aberdeen.
p304_084|nor should there have been.
p304_085|smoking is also very important.
p304_086|i have a theory.
p304_087|he was determined to write a novel.
p304_088|so is there anything left to say?
p304_089|my back is feeling really good.
p304_090|they've got their own agenda.
p304_091|this commitment should be built upon.
p304_092|it was one he was born to play.
p304_093|but we are losing that connection.
p304_094|he was jailed for five years.
p304_095|i am about protecting the state pension.
p304_096|we will look into it.
p304_097|but he's not afraid to take risks.
p304_098|we shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
p304_099|i live on the streets of glasgow.
p304_100|did you get the script?
p304_101|this is an exciting time in scottish politics.
p304_102|there you were just a body.
p304_103|he will suspend it on thursday afternoon.
p304_104|four people died instantly.
p304_105|he did not know his daughter.
p304_106|jim wallace has been running the government.
p304_107|our children are the future of our society.
p304_108|nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
p304_109|i can't believe it's all gone.
p304_110|i am just going to go for it.
p304_111|we will meet again.
p304_112|we are about to have our own parliament.
p304_113|part of the complex is historic.
p304_114|we need to chat.
p304_115|justice was not seen today.
p304_116|among them are many criminals.
p304_117|this is not about revenge.
p304_118|how can we ignore it?
p304_119|it's totally double standards.
p304_120|strikers like to go to the ground.
p304_121|it's something he works hard at achieving.
p304_122|we are taking the back seat on this.
p304_123|it was a privilege to work for him.
p304_124|but he admits he is deeply upset.
p304_125|we told them in august.
p304_126|we are going to have a parade.
p304_127|that could be at least five years away.
p304_128|that is my role.
p304_129|everyone can be bought.
p304_130|you would be a fool not to listen.
p304_131|no other offers apply.
p304_132|have you noticed?
p304_133|this is a wonderful honour for me.
p304_134|the lobby is not failing.
p304_135|it was a takeover.
p304_136|that statement has never been withdrawn.
p304_137|broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p304_138|how many cases have there been?
p304_139|but we have to plan for the future.
p304_140|and yet his legacy is doubtful.
p304_141|this advice was accepted by ministers.
p304_142|that's a pretty good percentage.
p304_143|i feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p304_144|i can't remember a lot about the accident.
p304_145|you have to think not.
p304_146|this is a total mystery.
p304_147|they were due to have begun today.
p304_148|do not listen to them.
p304_149|so what makes it so special?
p304_150|it will be easier for us.
p304_151|i'm pleased for him.
p304_152|the report will be launched in glasgow today.
p304_153|you need a trademark.
p304_154|this is our olympics.
p304_155|things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
p304_156|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p304_157|my goal was very important to the team.
p304_158|there are plenty examples.
p304_159|this is not a scottish problem.
p304_160|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p304_161|i have worked with him on projects.
p304_162|it may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p304_163|it was nice to get a clean sheet.
p304_164|and there is no cause for it.
p304_165|i really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p304_166|what has changed?
p304_167|manchester united were still trying up to yesterday.
p304_168|it is a symbolic concert.
p304_169|he asked me how they were doing.
p304_170|they would have looked out for each other.
p304_171|i've got three other ideas for the day.
p304_172|well it had to be something that's for sure.
p304_174|on saturday it was much the same.
p304_175|i think that's a bit of an invasion.
p304_176|the result today is an impasse.
p304_177|nelson does not disappoint.
p304_178|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p304_179|the real world is full of competing causes.
p304_180|they've got to decide to do that.
p304_181|strathclyde police declined to comment.
p304_182|these are terrible offences.
p304_183|this is it finally finished.
p304_184|an announcement is expected today on their future.
p304_185|there were so many characters among them.
p304_186|or is it the european approach?
p304_187|we could not get any possession.
p304_188|did you see that?
p304_189|the cost of war is more than that.
p304_190|i saw the whole thing.
p304_191|there is a demand for another hospice.
p304_192|there is a contract in existence for allan.
p304_193|then they were awarded a penalty.
p304_194|journalists should make him.
p304_195|they will have five minutes to decide.
p304_196|i see that any day now.
p304_197|but who knows?
p304_198|he was tough and relentless.
p304_199|that would be unlawful.
p304_200|this guy is amazing.
p304_201|the same goes for mckenna.
p304_202|that is no use.
p304_203|they will want to perform well.
p304_204|we should not worry about other players.
p304_205|ownership was the game.
p304_206|their moment had come or so they said.
p304_207|i love the moment of being first.
p304_208|some examples are presented in detail.
p304_209|you cannot understand it until you experience it.
p304_210|anything that can be done the government will do.
p304_211|i sincerely hope that will not change.
p304_212|just don't go looking to be shocked.
p304_213|it was total confusion.
p304_214|i have learned from him.
p304_215|pupils will be the losers.
p304_216|the position on the euro remains unchanged.
p304_217|such actions are rarely popular.
p304_218|that is why it is so lyrical.
p304_219|it isn't a happy memory.
p304_220|a spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p304_221|who would be a referee?
p304_222|we have a team to reach the final.
p304_223|we want to be separate from our neighbours.
p304_224|he was correct in everything he did.
p304_225|i see no reason for them to be.
p304_226|i never agreed with that.
p304_227|he was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p304_228|i don't think it is vital.
p304_229|but he insisted that victory was possible.
p304_230|that could run into millions.
p304_231|it might not survive the process.
p304_232|the truth is it is somewhere in the middle.
p304_233|i'm really excited about the album.
p304_234|we were desperate to get the game on.
p304_235|but there is a possible place.
p304_236|you can't have it both ways.
p304_237|offered the gold medal he declined.
p304_238|but they will need to play to score.
p304_239|he is a joy to watch.
p304_240|they also have good neighbours.
p304_241|we are now open.
p304_242|she said she would not welcome the flowers.
p304_243|there is no pressure from anyone now.
p304_244|now it has become a big picture.
p304_245|we want to learn lessons from that.
p304_246|he can perform well under pressure.
p304_247|i've enjoyed the whole experience.
p304_248|he was totally without that form of fear.
p304_249|the band was good and it's been a great day.
p304_250|all is busy but not much is happening.
p304_251|they have the cash to do that.
p304_252|this is a defining moment in this parliament.
p304_253|he wouldn't have played in all three.
p304_254|and that includes the barnett formula.
p304_255|it is a great shame.
p304_256|but experts have disputed that statistic.
p304_257|the council has been open and transparent.
p304_258|i'll never think of myself as a star.
p304_259|i felt he was excellent.
p304_260|it was a policy they were against.
p304_261|the results are sometimes contentious.
p304_262|i believe that scotland has much to gain.
p304_263|people have been wonderful beyond belief.
p304_264|had she enjoyed the experience?
p304_265|he has changed the country itself.
p304_266|the look on his face was something special.
p304_267|i can certainly see much better.
p304_268|we then went to see the headmaster.
p304_269|i needed a little man in the crowd.
p304_270|it would then be up to the judge.
p304_271|are we going to stay up?
p304_272|people were actually not on his side.
p304_273|it was a very difficult period.
p304_274|it's all going to clear the debt.
p304_275|it used to be less than five minutes.
p304_276|it was by the numbers.
p304_277|my dad is a hero.
p304_278|it is my fault.
p304_279|we are not asking for the moon.
p304_280|that used to be another thing of mine.
p304_281|at the election we will oppose the euro.
p304_282|as a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p304_283|teachers have been given the offer.
p304_284|he called for a public inquiry.
p304_285|i haven't had a lesson in four years.
p304_286|i played badly but it happens.
p304_287|i have got a wife to feed.
p304_288|i lost my head.
p304_289|what are the barriers?
p304_290|he is keen to stay in public service.
p304_291|you are not going in blind.
p304_292|you had to go and see him.
p304_293|she says she has grown up.
p304_294|he met his wife and married in england.
p304_295|but it could have been written for her.
p304_296|it makes no sense.
p304_297|what will they called?
p304_298|we come here in peace for peace.
p304_299|he will feel the pain again.
p304_300|after new labour we now have new unionists.
p304_301|i can't stand this sort of stuff.
p304_302|is saddam a threat?
p304_303|the jury is still out.
p304_304|hopefully they will not go through with it.
p304_305|i can't say that this is very usual.
p304_306|he is married with two children.
p304_307|at riverside the rematch was totally different.
p304_308|we are the gateway to justice.
p304_309|as in battle the worst thing is waiting for it.
p304_310|we understand the changes in the world.
p304_311|it is a potential factor.
p304_312|the working families tax credit is far better.
p304_313|it added to the reverence.
p304_314|it is too early to say.
p304_315|it's to do with context.
p304_316|david trimble has sold out.
p304_317|everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p304_318|i don't understand it.
p304_319|the teenager had been missing for six months.
p304_320|he was rejected because he had retired.
p304_321|and then we got off the plane.
p304_322|i think it is wide open.
p304_323|i am totally surprised.
p304_324|we are all ecstatic.
p304_325|i hope he has learned from it.
p304_326|that doesn't just happen you have to build it.
p304_327|you are a gambling man.
p304_328|who honestly expected anything else?
p304_329|the search has been called off.
p304_330|the matter will come up again.
p304_331|our strategy is straightforward.
p304_332|surely this is not supposed to happen?
p304_333|we must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p304_334|they were unable to revive him.
p304_335|this has come as a shock to everyone.
p304_336|yes it was too short a night.
p304_337|it is not for me though.
p304_338|it really was my favourite.
p304_339|that is why this action has been taken.
p304_340|they should be looking at his victims.
p304_341|there were many positives for this club.
p304_342|it's all about money money money.
p304_343|there wasn't anything in it.
p304_344|what do we do for an encore?
p304_345|things start to talk to each other.
p304_346|i would like to stay with rangers.
p304_347|saddam hussein is a devil.
p304_348|thirty people have applied for his job
p304_349|that is a lot of writing.
p304_350|there is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p304_351|it is no place for a poet.
p304_352|there is room for me.
p304_353|my life is in the ballet.
p304_354|for next season we have time to restructure.
p304_355|the truth of course is very different.
p304_356|he has something in common with the wallabies.
p304_357|these will take a little time to develop.
p304_358|this is not a birthday party.
p304_359|darren is very very good.
p304_360|it's a drop in the bucket.
p304_361|i've had a hard time to be honest.
p304_362|i'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p304_363|she is still very poorly.
p304_364|that's how she wants to remember him.
p304_365|there was no disruption to services.
p304_366|we talk about effective military action.
p304_367|it was a discussion paper.
p304_368|my neighbours are horrified.
p304_369|he had no problem with alcohol.
p304_370|this was a very tragic accident.
p304_371|if you can make it there you can make it anywhere.
p304_372|it is the voice of the survivors.
p304_373|i'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p304_374|i wish him well.
p304_375|only the details have to be sorted out.
p304_376|they say they feel different.
p304_377|we are in the hat.
p304_378|well what can you do?
p304_379|motorists will welcome this.
p304_380|it is not the message alone.
p304_381|she failed to win any of them.
p304_382|he is at war with his knee.
p304_383|i think we're going to make it.
p304_384|i didn't know where they were.
p304_385|clubs can only do so much.
p304_386|many other areas are coming up.
p304_387|but it's a subtle process.
p304_388|but let's not go down that road.
p304_389|it is not attempting to offer a solution.
p304_390|changes need to be made.
p304_391|i don't care to recall it.
p304_392|that's the way things are heading.
p304_393|hard it will be.
p304_394|he just attracted people.
p304_395|it was better than a soap opera.
p304_396|i doubt it would be genuine.
p304_397|you must be ready to play anyone.
p304_398|it would have been a very explosive issue.
p304_399|it seems a waste of talents.
p304_400|it is the worst of both worlds.
p304_401|we need to tighten up.
p304_402|his body was never found.
p304_403|just get on with your job.
p304_404|we expect a full house on the night.
p304_405|he said it was his greatest work.
p304_406|the baby deserves the credit.
p304_407|they are different types.
p304_408|like everything in scotland it takes time.
p304_409|we are not too surprised.
p304_410|they are not a set of options.
p304_411|but it was money well spent.
p304_412|they would never let him go.
p304_413|which is worse?
p304_414|at the end of the day one has to be careful.
p304_415|parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p304_416|he took over our lives.
p304_417|i would think they are just behind them.
p304_418|we would all have liked to run.
p304_419|i can understand why they have gone.
p304_420|that though was then.
p304_421|people should not become complacent.
p304_422|i will go out with him any time.
p304_423|i would have the hammer in the crowd.
p304_424|public safety is paramount.
p305_001|please call stella.
p305_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p305_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p305_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p305_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p305_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p305_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p305_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p305_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p305_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p305_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p305_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p305_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p305_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p305_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p305_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p305_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p305_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p305_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p305_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p305_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p305_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p305_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p305_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p305_025|last year however it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p305_026|he added however that all options are under review.
p305_027|we knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p305_028|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p305_029|which brings us to the scottish connection.
p305_030|it is a catalogue of obstruction.
p305_031|i'm happy to contribute to that.
p305_032|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p305_033|we had a reunion last week.
p305_034|we have high hopes that this will work.
p305_035|everyone around the club was supportive.
p305_036|people ask about the concept of a team.
p305_037|who has he fought?
p305_038|i want a free vote.
p305_039|he came close to signing for rangers too.
p305_040|it would show them a positive way forward.
p305_041|players were held in equally low regard.
p305_042|he also admitted possessing a firearm.
p305_043|he stands on centre court alone.
p305_044|both reports appeared in the british medical journal.
p305_045|there was a fine line to tread.
p305_046|they receive a high profile in the media.
p305_047|they were urged to get themselves in order.
p305_048|i've been asked that already this morning on the radio.
p305_049|here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305_050|but don't expect an easy ride.
p305_051|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p305_052|some us embassy staff have left the country.
p305_053|her mother said she fell off a swing.
p305_054|we see little sign of improvement.
p305_055|the study carried out by the consumer magazine which?
p305_056|ten years on that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p305_057|for example they could be in school uniform.
p305_058|this film will be totally awesome.
p305_059|three further cases were confirmed yesterday in scotland.
p305_060|there is no mandate for a regime change.
p305_061|he did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305_062|that tells you something about them.
p305_063|the father was treated like a criminal and why?
p305_064|this rule is archaic.
p305_065|i am a drug addict.
p305_066|i've had to take time off work today.
p305_067|this wasn't just a big crowd.
p305_068|i wondered about changing back to rugby.
p305_069|donald dewar was passionate about his politics.
p305_070|however consumers may take a different view.
p305_071|nancy is not sure how she feels.
p305_072|how do you resurrect a dying town?
p305_073|i've put my own money into this project.
p305_074|i've come here for the jersey.
p305_075|it's been a terrible ordeal for margaret.
p305_076|i'm so proud of my team.
p305_077|that would open the gates of hell.
p305_078|this has not and has been neglected.
p305_079|waiting times for these services are too long.
p305_080|if you're a national company you must provide it all.
p305_081|in the event it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p305_082|but they must serve their sentence in scotland.
p305_083|however it is much bigger than that.
p305_084|this season has been great for me it's been an experience.
p305_085|the jury is still out.
p305_086|he asked me in a tolerance zone.
p305_087|for now though my future is with rangers.
p305_088|i drove the ball well.
p305_089|if so how does it intend to achieve this result?
p305_090|his handling raises a wider issue.
p305_091|this is not a recipe for conflict.
p305_092|he had done his homework properly.
p305_093|you've got it coming kabul.
p305_094|alan milburn the health secretary refused to comment.
p305_095|we will have to see but it makes you think.
p305_096|we must keep our feet on the ground.
p305_097|my grandparents were terrified.
p305_098|are they control freaks?
p305_099|i haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p305_100|they never looked like winning it either.
p305_101|the party lasted all night.
p305_102|no details of the talks were given.
p305_103|it is understood they saw one body.
p305_104|it was a wilful act of violence.
p305_105|t is there anything in the wound?
p305_106|some realism was needed about time resources and management.
p305_107|the research is published in the journal nature.
p305_108|she is a double victim.
p305_109|they make a selective perception process.
p305_110|everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
p305_111|it's the way we go about it.
p305_112|there was an e mail.
p305_113|sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p305_114|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p305_115|each day is a new beginning.
p305_116|my daughter is an adult.
p305_117|pity he couldn't produce a winning british team.
p305_118|we've come from a long way back.
p305_119|a lot of things can go wrong.
p305_120|he seemed to lose his focus.
p305_121|it is a vicious circle.
p305_122|she was eight months pregnant at the time.
p305_123|there has been no delay on government orders.
p305_124|women were mostly notable by their absence.
p305_125|everyone needs a holiday even the salvation army.
p305_126|i would welcome a proper public discussion on this issue.
p305_127|how do you respond to losing your child?
p305_128|who is the employer?
p305_129|this is the biggest thing in the world isn't it?
p305_130|mcmaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p305_131|on this form they have a real chance of going up.
p305_132|two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p305_133|you can never have enough money.
p305_134|being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p305_135|i could hardly keep up with professor mckean.
p305_136|our plans for dunfermline have not changed.
p305_137|paterson can afford to be generous.
p305_138|another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p305_139|they do the work you know.
p305_140|thus far we have received no complaints.
p305_141|i haven't made the donation yet.
p305_142|other people also tried.
p305_143|slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p305_144|it would have very little impact on them.
p305_145|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p305_146|my future is in the marathon.
p305_147|they were even being used by primary pupils.
p305_148|this event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p305_149|they chose to side with terror.
p305_150|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p305_151|they just made me feel dizzy.
p305_152|he must have sat down relieved it was over.
p305_153|he will do so today in monte carlo.
p305_154|health care workers and labourers followed.
p305_155|blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p305_156|yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p305_157|we have all been shocked by her death.
p305_158|we are asking the council to think again.
p305_159|he had worked there for only two days.
p305_160|hopefully now we're getting it.
p305_161|but someone forgot to tell the chechens.
p305_162|for starters many of the scotland team didn't turn up.
p305_163|they want to shut the scottish office.
p305_164|scotland need to work on two key areas.
p305_165|we have already begun to do that here.
p305_166|the home team also had their moments.
p305_167|they refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p305_168|in my opinion it was a mistake and never on purpose.
p305_169|that is where the club has gone wrong.
p305_170|i got off to a great start.
p305_171|it is scheduled to go ahead next saturday.
p305_172|the actor has met with mandela.
p305_173|singing has gone out of fashion.
p305_174|we begin as ever with a reminder of the end.
p305_175|i got on very well with allan.
p305_176|that has given me great confidence.
p305_177|this is a dream come true for me.
p305_178|he was lying face down in the water.
p305_179|he urged people to forgive.
p305_180|so he is open to ideas.
p305_181|central to their cause was barry nicholson.
p305_182|not that anyone has actually suffered for her art.
p305_183|we are expected to do better than before.
p305_184|the attacker died in the crash.
p305_185|i am not even thinking about that.
p305_186|angola was a really hard place.
p305_187|it is giving out the wrong message.
p305_188|it wasn't a flashy performance it was very workmanlike.
p305_189|the sleeper was six hours late.
p305_190|tax is a matter for national governments.
p305_191|we want to keep the pound.
p305_192|this isn't a betrayal of public services it's their renewal.
p305_193|he needed seven hours of surgery.
p305_194|mind you he hasn't been back for ages.
p305_195|it just came into my head that day.
p305_196|eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p305_197|they were later released and last night were staying with relatives.
p305_198|i am saddened to hear of the accident.
p305_199|suddenly it was indeed a new ball game.
p305_200|he would help me with the form.
p305_201|the actors just have to say so.
p305_202|the minister is the engineer.
p305_203|i think it was briefly considered.
p305_204|it's a hidden problem.
p305_205|i lost a part of me.
p305_206|surely if anything it would be the other way round.
p305_207|it's part of the game isn't it?
p305_208|i believe in the church.
p305_209|others were even less confident.
p305_210|it will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p305_211|so people will come out with these things.
p305_212|you may have a short memory.
p305_213|my only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p305_214|the whole thing is utterly transparent.
p305_215|every game against new zealand is.
p305_216|that doesn't mean the cabinet has to endorse.
p305_217|he takes his time and won't be rushed.
p305_218|it shows that painting is still relevant.
p305_219|then there's one where people play for fun.
p305_220|it may be his last for a while too.
p305_221|they have enough intrusion at the time.
p305_222|then one night only three people turn up.
p305_223|the parents will have a great time too.
p305_224|now we see the impact of global politics.
p305_225|borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p305_226|appointments should be made on merit.
p305_227|there have been a lot of lessons learned.
p305_228|i think we will join the single currency.
p305_229|gilbert was not amused.
p305_230|everything was up for grabs.
p305_231|i think overall they were the best team in the tournament.
p305_232|there will not be any charges.
p305_233|nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p305_234|ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p305_235|i think we have a very strong case.
p305_236|it should be a great game though.
p305_237|you see it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p305_238|usually you should leave it alone in the box.
p305_239|so the process was refined.
p305_240|i know when my time is it doesn't bother me.
p305_241|i have been here for only three months.
p305_242|they were not doing it too well either.
p305_243|he added it's not a racial problem.
p305_244|we hope this scheme will change that.
p305_245|how could anyone take issue with that?
p305_246|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p305_247|they were at her bedside when she died.
p305_248|they had had time for little else.
p305_249|we have reports of this throughout scotland.
p305_250|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p305_251|she did not attend the courtroom.
p305_252|in the meantime he added prevention was the key.
p305_253|the composer therefore believes he can do it.
p305_254|i still feel like a wee boy.
p305_255|he will be sentenced tomorrow by lord dawson.
p305_256|but there was a shift.
p305_257|israel has done very little until now.
p305_258|debate was impassioned and furious.
p305_259|the death rates are still as high.
p305_260|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p305_261|we certainly will need to watch him.
p305_262|i don't think it could be clearer.
p305_263|we can only go up.
p305_264|he put some colour into scottish history.
p305_265|our offer will remain on the table.
p305_266|he is a man who lives to work.
p305_267|the website is now being amended.
p305_268|it's an internal matter.
p305_269|if you could have dinner with anyone who would it be?
p305_270|the breakdown was much later in her life.
p305_271|whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p305_272|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p305_273|i hadn't seen them in eight years.
p305_274|don hutchison too is a threat.
p305_275|i am now just a bit uneasy.
p305_276|however sharon rejected the claims.
p305_277|they married in august last year.
p305_278|yet he chose to do something different.
p305_279|he was happy the bbc was happy the listeners were happy.
p305_280|the case will now go to appeal.
p305_281|they really did a great job.
p305_282|our nation has been changed by this event.
p305_283|it was worth a photograph.
p305_284|i love you so very much.
p305_285|the road was closed for several hours.
p305_286|in time may prove a worthy successor to billy dodds.
p305_287|surrey police said no body had been found.
p305_288|my aim is a top six finish.
p305_289|we would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p305_290|thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p305_291|i love the tradition of vaudeville.
p305_292|most of the public are behind me.
p305_293|it really is a gift to the world.
p305_294|this comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p305_295|my house was shaking at the time.
p305_296|i'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p305_297|this is a very positive step forward.
p305_298|this is a huge confidence boost.
p305_299|that's how it worked in bosnia.
p305_300|nobody even knew it had happened.
p305_301|she is a very lucky lady.
p305_302|we've been there for seven years.
p305_303|they made a huge impression on me.
p305_304|his signature is his handwriting.
p305_305|he admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p305_306|it also highlighted some local hero districts.
p305_307|the project is entitled the composer in scotland.
p305_308|it worked up to a point.
p305_309|one season they might do well.
p305_310|now it is official barry ferguson is staying with rangers.
p305_311|we've got a great defensive club.
p305_312|it's up to their parents to choose.
p305_313|i feel privileged to be here.
p305_314|she told me to apply for the crest.
p305_315|i think the government should pay for that.
p305_316|it is still holding good today.
p305_317|the budget was too low for that.
p305_318|his sister added we expected him to be jailed.
p305_319|the airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p305_320|we cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
p305_321|i know the worry over iraq.
p305_322|i just could not cope.
p305_323|we didn't know he was even out.
p305_324|scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p305_325|here are some possible solutions.
p305_326|he made so many bad decisions.
p305_327|we are now up against it.
p305_328|it is anything but erotic but that is probably the point.
p305_329|i would have dropped out otherwise.
p305_330|nato would ensure they could return home he said.
p305_331|they have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p305_332|i think he has undergone a sea change.
p305_333|one must hope not
p305_334|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p305_335|from a marketing standpoint you can understand their concern.
p305_336|that might happen in pakistan but in britain?
p305_337|that's what it's all about isn't it?
p305_338|when people talk about the beach boys and brian wilson.
p305_339|this time there were no such rewards.
p305_340|before he left the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p305_341|i'm just doing artwork.
p305_342|and we still have to pay his salary.
p305_343|having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p305_344|so there's a double whammy.
p305_345|i didn't have a trio.
p305_346|their three other children had died as infants.
p305_347|we knew nothing about it.
p305_348|i am astonished by this decision.
p305_349|i hope my successor will do the same.
p305_350|we have got a full house tonight.
p305_351|our children are our future.
p305_352|we will see how he is.
p305_353|the fans will support us.
p305_354|it was a long process but we got there.
p305_355|it has however been a long time coming.
p305_356|the whole team was rubbish.
p305_357|now we need to keep our heads up.
p305_358|i put the drawing down.
p305_359|they feel it belongs to them.
p305_360|they must act now to tighten the rules.
p305_361|they too refused to come out and talk.
p305_362|it gave me something to focus on.
p305_363|it's the curse of our time irony.
p305_364|it's a source of deep concern.
p305_365|eating was a nightmare and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p305_366|but it was for charity just a bit of fun.
p305_367|last month he made his debut in japan.
p305_368|the dow jones is way up.
p305_369|now there is an even bigger target.
p305_370|there has been a big change in defence.
p305_371|the treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p305_372|there is nothing like a fresh start.
p305_373|the company has other problems with the shells.
p305_374|this must have been severe.
p305_375|we're all in a state of shock.
p305_376|i thought he was part of the camera.
p305_377|farmers have been an endangered species.
p305_378|injury has played a part but not a big one.
p305_379|meanwhile the business of government goes on.
p305_380|he was released in march this year.
p305_381|the chosen one doesn't always excel.
p305_382|lambert will be playing against belgium.
p305_383|we're not an employment agency.
p305_384|people might not actually want the job.
p305_385|the court had a number of empty seats.
p305_386|it is the logical extension of audio description.
p305_387|it broke up my marriage.
p305_388|two years ago the commission did not want to get involved.
p305_389|he also was in debt to drug dealers.
p305_390|the package has been properly costed.
p305_391|this is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p305_392|the love affair was over.
p305_393|for some it was more painful than others.
p305_394|john reid the northern ireland secretary yesterday appealed for restraint.
p305_395|i can't stop people thinking.
p305_396|the workers said they were treated like animals.
p305_397|she had every right to read the warrant.
p305_398|several people were out in the street.
p305_399|there is too much at stake for that.
p305_400|a review group will report on tuesday.
p305_401|in some cases the nation should be grateful.
p305_402|the place became a war zone.
p305_403|it is not an abortion.
p305_404|it was to get even better for motherwell.
p305_405|the surprise is its product is so poor.
p305_406|thus the story will continue to thrive.
p305_407|see it while you can.
p305_408|i didn't do too badly myself.
p305_409|their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p305_410|he has never even been to ireland.
p305_411|we believe the squad will stay together.
p305_412|such people do not exist.
p305_413|we suspect he was pleased.
p305_414|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p305_415|she always wanted her own way.
p305_416|but it is all by design.
p305_417|we've still got a say in this.
p305_418|she can't say where she was what she did.
p305_419|i'll take what comes along.
p305_420|jack mcconnell is the obvious choice.
p305_421|women reported more depression than men.
p305_422|the euro is your money it is our money.
p306_001|please call stella.
p306_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p306_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p306_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p306_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p306_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p306_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p306_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its paths high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p306_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p306_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p306_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p306_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p306_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p306_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p306_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p306_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p306_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p306_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p306_019|since then physicists have found that is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p306_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p306_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p306_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p306_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p306_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p306_025|police were called to the scene according to the weekend reports.
p306_026|this is not a floating las vegas.
p306_027|this is not an amnesty.
p306_028|the important thing was to be there and to experience it.
p306_029|of course this is nice to hear.
p306_030|it was between myself the management and the team.
p306_031|i don't believe you own anything.
p306_032|the music industry hasn't changed at all.
p306_033|there will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p306_034|blood samples have been taken.
p306_035|someone came down and said can you read a script?
p306_036|he said he now intends to fly today.
p306_037|this means that our programme is quite unusual.
p306_038|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p306_039|a further police inquiry is currently being held.
p306_040|some people begin to turn away to go home.
p306_041|you're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p306_042|a recording contract is on the horizon.
p306_043|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p306_044|we like being the underdogs.
p306_045|they said construction work could begin within weeks.
p306_046|we will continue to operate within the sport.
p306_047|but the law is very clear on this.
p306_048|but all forms of the illness are treatable.
p306_049|it is also central to the unfolding drama.
p306_050|except for this it was offside.
p306_051|on the contrary some of the music is very expensive.
p306_052|it's a grey area.
p306_053|retirement who knows?
p306_054|he was shocked by what he saw.
p306_055|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p306_056|it comes on like a tidal wave.
p306_057|england and wales are likely to pull out.
p306_058|mr cook a left winger from britain would be ideally replaced.
p306_059|he was taken ill in december last year.
p306_060|we welcome the decisions of mr byers.
p306_061|it's all too short term.
p306_062|this he told the committee was not forthcoming.
p306_063|meanwhile the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p306_064|robin williams is very subdued.
p306_065|his rival's are spoken with elan.
p306_066|he also does not get on with christina.
p306_067|if convicted they face the death penalty.
p306_068|how things have changed since then.
p306_069|therefore it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p306_070|this is the way things should be handled.
p306_071|for me the tour is wide open this year.
p306_072|in the past few years they have started to fight back.
p306_073|the prime minister was very honest and sincere.
p306_074|what are you supposed to do just walk away?
p306_075|she opens tonight in glasgow at the king's theatre.
p306_076|henman is taking nothing for granted.
p306_077|you'd think there was a match on today.
p306_078|we must move on.
p306_079|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p306_080|the table was compiled by the daily telegraph.
p306_081|his options are severely limited.
p306_082|it is truly fields of miracles.
p306_083|they are not an item.
p306_084|why did they let him go?
p306_085|another suggestion was dismissed by virgin.
p306_086|i have made good progress.
p306_087|we do need a new one.
p306_088|they had to be cut from the wreckage.
p306_089|we defended well but couldn't do much in attack.
p306_090|what happens when the funding is exhausted.
p306_091|he then had a swipe at hearts.
p306_092|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p306_093|but the relief was short lived.
p306_094|you had better believe it.
p306_095|the mood is upbeat.
p306_096|they told us about it the next day.
p306_097|it's not a new concept in jazz.
p306_098|there are a huge number of arts.
p306_099|they are therefore not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p306_100|my office is bare.
p306_101|thereafter he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p306_102|where is the anthrax?
p306_103|housing is in very short supply.
p306_104|after all he is the king of scotland.
p306_105|people just came on their own.
p306_106|we are so so lucky so many people have died.
p306_107|the culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p306_108|you either have him or you don't.
p306_109|there are some new buildings in there.
p306_110|i am prepared to step down.
p306_111|i'm not a diva.
p306_112|there is great relief at this point.
p306_113|look at them after three days of rain.
p306_115|there is no point in pushing it.
p306_116|he was the deputy editor at the paper.
p306_117|yesterday mr hague dismissed the poll.
p306_118|few other services in scotland are affected the spokesman said.
p306_119|completion is expected by october the following year.
p306_120|however it very nearly all went wrong.
p306_121|it is not a definite proposal as yet.
p306_122|i will speak to michael about this.

p306_221|a world away from rangers you might say.
p306_222|it was a stunning drive from jon.
p306_223|she didn't tell us anything new.
p306_224|there is nothing like this back home.
p306_225|and that gives a kind of freedom.
p306_226|i found a fault and worked at it.
p306_227|it was a poor performance.
p306_228|they may yet have the last laugh.
p306_229|you can feel at home in china.

p306_246|around the building the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p306_247|the performance for this listener didn't come off.

p306_250|brown is an interesting man but he is not desperate.
p306_251|i am totally horrified by the sentence.

p306_276|the threat to rural areas is real.
p306_277|tourism continues to struggle.
p306_278|that however can only be achieved by constant investment.
p306_279|but in the end he did and blew him away.
p306_281|this is a great shame.
p306_282|that was merely their initial problem.
p306_283|i'm going to help out in the summer as producer.
p306_284|we said what do you mean?
p306_285|i need them to set my career.
p306_286|the law will take its course.
p306_287|they don't know each other but they have made this commitment.
p306_288|it puts the thought out for other people to think about.
p306_289|the fund has three elements.
p306_290|this is a young team you know.
p306_291|it's not even finished.
p306_292|everyone knew where they were.
p306_293|as agreed the prime minister was driven to westminister hall.
p306_294|in the old days it was easy.
p306_295|people will make up their own minds.
p306_296|after that he became more romantic.
p306_297|there is bound to be a formal complaint.
p306_298|my view has now completely changed.
p306_299|they finished second and third.
p306_300|we agreed to disagree.
p306_301|he was then replaced by ross.
p306_302|it had not been a terribly inspiring end either.
p306_303|i'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p306_304|we've always had three options and none of them perfect.
p306_305|people can get them if they want.
p306_306|their message was simple.
p306_307|they're currently managed by ian wilson.
p306_308|he is a law unto himself.
p306_309|with him are the symbols of his faith.
p306_310|there are no easy solutions to this problem.
p306_311|an aide was instructed to get a copy.
p306_312|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p306_313|part of johnny was found some days after.
p306_314|it was just completely erased.
p306_315|a great deal has been achieved.
p306_316|i've been thinking about it for a year.
p306_317|i enjoy playing with both of them.
p306_318|too often it is not.
p306_319|i tend to not look back.
p306_320|confidence among the allies began to slip.
p306_321|i got a yellow card.
p306_322|technically it was a very good performance by scotland.
p306_323|i didn't know what he was capable of.
p306_324|our place as artists is to ask questions.
p306_325|it's good to start with judith.
p306_326|she is now on the back benches.
p306_327|it may also be her last.
p306_328|maybe it helps us.
p306_329|three bystanders were killed.
p306_330|we should savour this because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p306_331|however within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p306_332|he made no big mistakes.
p306_333|there has been no cover up just the opposite in fact.
p306_334|we will be homeless.
p306_335|i believe he can do a better job.
p306_336|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p306_337|instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p306_338|that decision was applauded by williamson.
p306_339|but their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p306_340|well was it?
p306_341|we won't let you down.
p306_342|what kind of person is he?
p306_343|does it work is it safe and is it right?
p306_344|he was visited by uk consular officials.
p306_345|so we shall remain vigilant and keep the pressure on him.
p306_346|english is the language of pop music.
p306_347|the israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p306_348|it is a simple equation.
p306_349|she has seen or heard it all.
p306_351|this time however there is a new venue.
p306_354|you can leave him knowing the job will be done.
p306_355|i didn't even have the first idea.
p306_356|no person was charged.
p306_357|i've only met him three times.
p306_358|you see my back has gone.
p306_359|it's a logical consequence of the formula.
p306_360|she looked very very poor.
p307_001|please call stella.
p307_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p307_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p307_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p307_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p307_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p307_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p307_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p307_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p307_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p307_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p307_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p307_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p307_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p307_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p307_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p307_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p307_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p307_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p307_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p307_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p307_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p307_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p307_025|but it was a great decision he joked.
p307_026|they changed the world of music.
p307_027|you need a long term strategy in football.
p307_028|the law has got to be upheld.
p307_029|but we're not the same person.
p307_030|he had just returned to thailand from canada.
p307_031|i saw the explosion and panicked.
p307_032|the punishment was swift.
p307_033|however there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p307_034|i kept my side of the bargain.
p307_035|it also makes for interesting viewing.
p307_036|jacques chirac the french president was surely in his sights.
p307_037|he released a half dozen solo albums.
p307_038|that respect is missing in the netherlands.
p307_039|there's always a solution somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p307_040|hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p307_041|it doesn't make them evil.
p307_042|i have played really well all year.
p307_043|parts of the system are already overstretched.
p307_044|tourism in scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p307_045|it's like if he's all right we will go with him.
p307_046|she added it is the same story in both countries.
p307_047|lara is very very much a girl.
p307_048|i try not to expect anything.
p307_049|lord sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p307_050|there will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p307_051|it was however the wrong side.
p307_052|she is now planning a visit.
p307_053|it also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p307_054|here he is in effect appointing himself a judge.
p307_055|today we begin to answer that question.
p307_056|no it wasn't supposed to do that officials admitted.
p307_057|i keep my fingers crossed.
p307_058|the encounter was to change his life.
p307_059|it's the best of both worlds.
p307_060|they have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p307_061|that is why we want this decision reversed.
p307_062|it didn't work against sweden but that was the intention.
p307_063|staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p307_064|we tried everything but it just wasn't to be today.
p307_065|after this the exercise was due to begin.
p307_066|and she doesn't feel like annika is better.
p307_067|i want my country to be a republic not an empire.
p307_068|celtic connections is here again and the great debate.
p307_069|i'm just feeling very tired but it's great.
p307_070|when he took over it really took off.
p307_071|that's just the way the game is evolving.
p307_072|michael is putting on a brave face.
p307_073|hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p307_074|the next thing will be cutting journey times.
p307_075|it's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p307_076|this is a mental challenge.
p307_077|their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p307_078|he accused the prime minister of dithering.
p307_079|without approval the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p307_080|ferguson did not hesitate.
p307_081|he came in an army uniform.
p307_082|however within those figures income from overseas visitors increased.
p307_083|cars are great for going long distances.
p307_084|it was published yesterday on the internet.
p307_085|i knew he would play two weeks ago.
p307_086|the general secretary represents a new era in labour party politics.
p307_087|it has never been worthwhile.
p307_088|so other options had to be explored.
p307_089|he is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p307_090|we will learn lessons from what has happened.
p307_091|people love to see this stuff.
p307_092|one film a year is he says his natural rhythm.
p307_093|three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p307_094|his female companion was being treated for shock.
p307_095|i have no plans to change the oath.
p307_096|we did not even get a free kick.
p307_097|he was married with a young child.
p307_098|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p307_099|anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p307_100|they serve a multitude of purposes.
p307_101|but his attendance is not guaranteed.
p307_102|i am sure all schools would accept that.
p307_103|i am very sorry to be here.
p307_104|i needed a change a new challenge.
p307_105|is your life a little too easy?
p307_106|i think my game is suited to grass.
p307_107|the little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p307_108|industry leaders reacted angrily.
p307_109|europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p307_110|people want to see me on the screen.
p307_111|the labour party's not downbeat and neither is the labour government.
p307_112|and that is our first victory in edinburgh.
p307_113|the conversion didn't go over either.
p307_114|he took away my childhood.
p307_115|they hoped to remain in the edinburgh area.
p307_116|the motive for the shooting was not known.
p307_117|since then they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p307_118|serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p307_119|it is not great art.
p307_120|you do not change overnight.
p307_121|the way they play it is hard to score against them.
p307_122|one the acute services trust will run the general hospital services.
p307_123|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p307_124|we all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p307_125|we aim to put them out of business.
p307_126|tony blair should get out more.
p307_127|we didn't enjoy the first game but today they were excellent.
p307_128|he was just awesome.
p307_129|we now have to concentrate on the league.
p307_130|we need to move forward together.
p307_131|she died in hospital two hours later.
p307_132|she was making a living but her career was going nowhere.
p307_133|both were later released after a check up.
p307_134|no one however was complacent about the size of the task.
p307_135|how good is lennox lewis?
p307_136|i would ask the fans to be patient.
p307_137|the ethos of the school was outstanding.
p307_138|the son has autism and other problems.
p307_139|i'm very puzzled by it.
p307_140|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p307_141|volvo is grateful to its staff in irvine.
p307_142|we are both very confused and extremely angry.
p307_143|all things are possible if you believe.
p307_144|this was not just incongruous.
p307_145|it is patently true.
p307_146|you hope he prevails.
p307_147|and a mightily impressive recording it is too.
p307_148|the fellowship is much more than a commission he said.
p307_149|what the department of transport will make clear.
p307_150|but it looks good for next year.
p307_151|i haven't just gone in done a three hour rehearsal and gone.
p307_152|he is wanted by german police for questioning.
p307_153|he was forced to quit.
p307_154|it is good for their eyesight.
p307_155|i was loving that little girl.
p307_156|but you can't have it both ways.
p307_157|we don't just play golf in scotland.
p307_158|that's why the young musicians have joined.
p307_159|the death toll included five children.
p307_160|before the game we went for a pint.
p307_161|there is no credible official announcement.
p307_162|i understand the medical concerns.
p307_163|this is a united kingdom.
p307_164|i thought it was a fantastic game.
p307_165|i'm aware that somebody made a threat.
p307_166|however who could have predicted this result?
p307_167|shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p307_168|as long as it is possible we will keep going.
p307_169|they were behind the wheel.
p307_170|the pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p307_171|the problem arises because he does so much.
p307_172|the answer is mayhem.
p307_173|our young people are leaving.
p307_174|what then is the real thing?
p307_175|i can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p307_176|that will be the sweetness.
p307_177|but is it ethical to practice in humans?

p307_310|of further privacy he had no need.
p307_311|both sides have to step back.
p307_312|lord johnston will give a decision later.
p307_313|they scored a goal but we have to keep playing.
p307_314|it sounds a bit of an own goal.

p307_316|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p307_317|i look for dancers who are also actors.

p307_335|there was no let up for the minnows.

p307_341|i am not putting myself down.
p307_342|he's a joy to follow.
p307_343|bob dylan is getting old.
p307_344|we were lucky to have survived.
p307_345|maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p307_346|at this level you have all to perform well.
p307_347|i just want to change my life.
p307_348|he did not oppose the divorce.
p307_349|connell was standing there ordering her to get up.
p307_350|and michael was just great.
p307_351|he knew it would cost him millions.
p307_352|law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p307_353|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p307_354|clearly she says she would never resort to such devices.
p307_355|that only came out during a radio interview.
p307_356|we are now setting about finding them.
p307_357|they were the best team but unlucky in the end.
p307_358|we must not go down that road.
p307_359|it won't happen overnight but things will get better.

p307_373|and the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p307_374|scottish life can be like this too.
p307_375|he has changed my life for ever.
p307_376|the home was now under new management.
p307_377|it is like a theatre of the absurd.
p307_378|there is no openness.
p307_379|it's being very carefully looked at.
p307_380|it was a job he loved.
p307_381|it may encourage more people to prospect.
p307_382|filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
p307_383|where was their passion the power the feeling?
p307_384|it looks like paradise.
p307_386|we were short of athletes.
p307_387|they want to avoid a flashpoint.
p307_388|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.

p307_394|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p307_395|we have been working closely with holyrood.
p307_396|it was early morning.
p307_397|partition is not an option.
p307_398|what other retailer would do this?

p307_400|anyway even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p307_401|i won't go back to holland.
p307_402|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p307_403|there was no cohesion.
p307_404|he is very popular in the squad in england and abroad.
p307_405|whether this return was too soon.
p307_406|jackson may well be right.
p307_407|my thoughts are with their families.
p307_408|i saw some good things.
p307_410|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p307_411|still the experience was amazing she says.
p307_412|but who gets on the tube?
p307_413|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p307_414|now you see him now you don't.
p307_416|so now this series has had its day.
p307_417|gaelic provision continued to be good.
p307_418|bobby robson called him a genius.
p307_419|it's a policy which has worked for us.
p307_420|locally too the mp is under fire.
p307_421|his views are hardly surprising.
p307_422|his wife margaret was not in court.
p307_423|slowly however a picture is emerging in scotland.
p307_424|nobody else was with me.
p308_001|please call stella.
p308_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p308_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p308_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p308_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p308_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p308_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p308_008|they take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p308_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p308_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p308_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p308_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p308_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p308_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p308_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p308_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p308_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p308_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p308_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p308_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p308_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p308_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition on a number of bows.
p308_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p308_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p308_025|it does make a big difference.
p308_026|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p308_027|each one has its own system.
p308_028|alright it was a defeat but it felt like a victory.
p308_029|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p308_030|it is a very special city.
p308_031|it has been blown out of all proportion.
p308_032|he is not very big either.
p308_033|i've taken to the hills.
p308_034|my game is in pretty good shape.
p308_035|how come it is so often unnoticed?
p308_036|i wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p308_037|we used to keep our business rates.
p308_038|it's a delightful idea but a distancing one.
p308_039|all of us do.
p308_040|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p308_041|it could have been just a quick fix.
p308_042|we are looking for volunteers.

p308_070|but it was to no avail.
p308_071|there is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p308_072|i'm thinking what would be easier?
p308_073|that alibi is now gone.
p308_074|we actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p308_075|he now lives in edinburgh with his wife caroline.
p308_076|you do have a way out.

p308_089|it's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p308_090|the same goes for personnel.
p308_091|he was a crazy man.

p308_098|that certainly brought me back down to earth.
p308_099|glasgow deserved their win but we made them look good.
p308_100|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p308_101|because of this he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p308_102|does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p308_103|he is only now regaining his confidence.
p308_104|early warnings could help but it's a scary thought.
p308_105|it separates the men from the boys.
p308_106|but that attachment took a lot of growing.
p308_107|you'll get on like a house on fire.

p308_164|but they will not be compelled to join.
p308_165|however the referee was not in the giving vein.
p308_166|i was doing well at the hustings.
p308_167|but even without either glasgow will be outstanding.
p308_168|after his birthday scott was very upset.
p308_169|we must put a marker down.
p308_170|but she's also beautiful behind the face.
p308_171|there is no date on this document.
p308_172|and now he tells us.
p308_173|now though he is back playing superbly for blackburn.
p308_174|they did too but it didn't matter by then.
p308_175|it is time to come into the limelight.
p308_176|it should have a health warning it is addictive.
p308_177|his name is michael owen.
p308_178|for now we must take one game at a time.
p308_179|i will have to order its destruction.
p308_180|i foolishly had done nothing about it.
p308_181|again this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p308_182|by social devices the two groups are coming together.
p308_183|smith has not let him down.
p308_184|no it's actually in a block of flats.
p308_185|reviving the scottish open is one option.
p308_186|they've two children.
p308_187|luckily our patient was stable.
p308_188|i'm really proud of my young players.
p308_189|people buy everything with cash.
p308_190|there was great support all round the route.
p308_191|it's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p308_192|i felt we had fallen back a little.
p308_193|scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
p308_194|or so we have long assumed.
p308_195|public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p308_196|to which the only answer is don't hold your breath.
p308_197|it's not just for classical music.
p308_198|this must be kept in total perspective.
p308_199|all of the names are familiar to me.
p308_200|they had not been handcuffed.
p308_201|it was a lot of hard work but it wasn't difficult.
p308_202|i've never been limited on drugs.
p308_203|they could take the result away from them couldn't they.
p308_204|have we not had the rainy season already?
p308_205|we have chosen for the patients.
p308_206|he now describes himself as scottish labour.
p308_207|why should we even be asked to share?
p308_208|which means it matters.
p308_209|there is great potential on this river.
p308_210|i was surprised by his response.
p308_211|this is a one year deal but who knows?
p308_212|river city is a showcase for scottish talent.
p308_213|officials say the city must achieve this.
p308_214|it may mean more money but we don't need the money.
p308_215|is this accurate?
p308_216|a judicial review is also being considered.
p308_217|it used to bother me sometimes but it doesn't any more.
p308_218|they could go no further forward.
p308_219|i don't know why you say goodbye.
p308_220|appointed general secretary last september.
p308_221|they make it look very easy.
p308_222|it was a total surprise.
p308_223|i had enough on.
p308_224|and we're not there yet.
p308_225|no meaningful response was issued.
p308_226|it is a form of physical exercise.
p308_227|plays in dark blue.
p308_228|but by that time of course it is again.
p308_229|it is something that we will put right.
p308_230|survival is our aim.
p308_231|there is no reason at all.
p308_232|this is her first senior scottish selection.
p308_233|there is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p308_234|i'm pleased with the horse.
p308_235|but there are problems such as retraining new staff.
p308_236|there is a club on the rise.
p308_237|i had a sense of deja vu.
p308_238|his silence on the issue is interesting.
p308_239|they follow him everywhere.
p308_240|i couldn't make out what was going on.
p308_241|there was no safety net.
p308_242|so we said no we're not going to do that.
p308_243|i had a choice and didn't have to do that.
p308_244|i'm back playing football which is what it's all about.
p308_245|mr miller is married with three children.
p308_246|thankfully there were no reports of anything serious.
p308_247|we have great sympathy with danny.
p308_248|he should be a great asset.
p308_249|it means they actually control the programme.
p308_250|and also whatever he does can he really win?
p308_251|we are not out of touch with politics.
p308_252|we could have got three medals.
p308_253|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p308_254|we are at a crossroads.
p308_255|we are satisfied with this outcome.
p308_256|sounds like the sixth sense?
p308_257|it didn't take long.
p308_258|this meeting is the path to salvation.
p308_259|of course we make mistakes but we don't make too many.
p308_260|i started on fire a couple of times.
p308_261|he also received a medal of honour.
p308_262|it's not one for the purists.
p308_263|she said he showed no remorse.
p308_264|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p308_265|we always thought it should be digital and cheap.
p308_266|it is a time bomb.
p308_267|it's a matter of huge concern.
p308_268|harrowing is easy after all.
p308_269|three years probation is just a joke.
p308_270|the outstanding issues are still there.
p308_271|inclusion and autism is it working?
p308_272|i'm not sure how they got there but they are.
p308_273|and that's good news for the magpies.
p308_274|he always has been since his early days with scottish opera.
p308_275|that got me out of jail.
p308_276|we've turned the corner.
p308_277|this is not however a general election reshuffle.
p308_278|the dictator of iraq is not disarming.
p308_279|scottish women appear at eden court inverness tonight.
p308_280|however the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p308_281|we've taken steps to rectify it.
p308_282|i see no need for change.
p308_283|do yourselves a favour.
p308_284|therefore this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p308_285|others said they had been beaten by police.
p308_286|the new system will be marketed this summer.
p308_287|i'd love to be like peter.
p308_288|then came the collision with sergio.
p308_289|we also hope to meet the ulster unionists.
p308_290|holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p308_291|his is a success story by any standard.
p308_292|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p308_293|i shall be voting yes to support him.
p308_294|is something which we just don't do.
p308_295|we work on the same level.
p308_296|i've got a young family.
p308_297|i'm trying to stay open on that.
p308_298|it all seemed so easy.
p308_299|i really don't understand what is happening.
p308_300|the frustration was showing.
p308_301|shaking his head mr cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p308_302|i am a wealthy person.
p308_303|my friends were very envious.
p308_304|the snipers are also out.
p308_305|millions of british jobs depend on europe.
p308_306|we're determined to establish the facts.
p308_307|the abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p308_308|the list is too long for this piece.
p308_309|if you don't enforce it you bring it into disrepute.
p308_310|entries for the event are still being accepted.
p308_311|it plans to return to this field.
p308_312|however there was hope and glory too for scotland.
p308_313|to all intents and purposes he ran the show.
p308_314|tonight's matches european championship.
p308_315|it's like the russians.
p308_316|is that titanic?
p308_317|let us hope so.
p308_318|so the question is is it any good?
p308_319|i'm getting back up there now.
p308_320|i couldn't see any reason not to die.
p308_321|my players have no idea about football.
p308_322|they are there to get people into work.
p308_323|i'm getting long in the tooth.
p308_324|they would be wise to do just that.
p308_325|strathclyde police yesterday declined to comment on ferris.
p308_326|some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p308_327|crucially though united were still alive.
p308_328|charles gordon leader of glasgow city council declined to comment.
p308_329|she had gone to the catholic school.
p308_330|then we will face the danish champions.
p308_331|i'd go to bookshops.
p308_332|it is time to fight a decisive battle.
p308_333|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p308_334|its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p308_335|military chiefs were playing it straight.
p308_336|adams is surely worth a chance.
p308_337|there was no hint of bravado.
p308_338|you've been a great audience.
p308_339|adventure is the champagne of life.
p308_340|by then however both men were already in the us.
p308_341|she's a valuable member of the government.
p308_342|i just need a bit of luck.
p308_343|the feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p308_344|i always felt they played for me.
p308_345|again it's about responding to your resources.
p308_346|managers and clinicians must work together.
p308_347|the princess has had other health problems.
p308_348|everything else is a bonus.
p308_349|the hotel was now for sale.
p308_350|there are two games to go after that.
p308_351|almost the day after the election the battle lines were drawn.
p308_352|his replacement was named yesterday following inquiries by the herald.
p308_353|investment in quality service and marketing were the only way forward.
p308_354|she now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p308_355|it was a uk wide report.
p308_356|this is a dreadful day for iona.
p308_357|he spoke about the choices facing them and their country.
p308_358|it could be done by experts and lawyers.
p308_359|the discussions will surely not last too long.
p308_360|we'll talk about mr michael johnson and he is awesome.
p308_361|they have not let anyone into the loop.
p308_362|so just what is her enduring appeal?
p308_363|it's not easy to live in russia.
p308_364|i think the commission has been very very slow to react.
p308_365|last night was a key episode.
p308_366|i grew up listening to these people.
p308_367|it is normal for me.
p308_368|but it may not be all bad news.
p308_369|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p308_370|i am content with the silver.
p308_371|we have fun in our lives.
p308_372|this too could prove a risky business.
p308_373|you have to audition for jobs.
p308_374|we're not comparing like with like.
p308_375|ferguson should take note.
p308_376|we have always been and remain confident of securing the order.
p308_377|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p308_378|they've got three quarters of the way.
p308_379|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p308_380|she was released from hospital yesterday.
p308_381|that is not just my personal view.
p308_382|the move follows a review of the singapore
p308_383|it's like a garage.
p308_384|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p308_385|it is a triumphant performance which defies the years.
p308_386|liberal democrat leader makes a hash of it.
p308_387|you just have to accept.
p308_388|we've got to get it right.
p308_389|the trouble is though that there is no simple solution.
p308_390|his death was a tragic accident.
p308_391|would you take them?
p308_392|i find it puzzling and disturbing.
p308_393|he lost his job but it was not just a job.
p308_394|his condition was stable last night.
p308_395|i'd never seen a play about me.
p308_396|at present it is fairly uncommon but its incidence is increasing.
p308_397|the report is due out next month.
p308_398|it was nerve racking to watch.
p308_399|it remains in public ownership.
p308_400|the master was by then just too old.
p308_401|all credit to them they took their chances we didn't.
p308_402|sub not used mcarthur.
p308_403|it's a very high number.
p308_404|i leave tonight for england.
p308_405|she didn't tell me anything the night before.
p308_406|this is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p308_407|no evidence that it was osama bin laden.
p308_408|he was dead on arrival at hospital.
p308_409|i have no argument with scotland.
p308_410|there are simply no orders.
p308_411|sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p308_412|like anyone else he has to take his time.
p308_413|it is not an option but a policy requirement.
p308_414|the problem in norway is outside the national.
p308_415|she took them for a term.
p308_416|i haven't spoken to anyone about that not even my wife.
p308_417|jock brown is appointed as general manager.
p308_418|or so she thought.
p308_419|it was another good idea.
p308_420|this would discourage investment and job creation.
p308_421|the foreign office was conspicuous by its absence.
p308_422|last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p308_423|in fact they should have scored three times.
p310_001|please call stella.
p310_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p310_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p310_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p310_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p310_006|when the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p310_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p310_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p310_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p310_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p310_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p310_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p310_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p310_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p310_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p310_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
p310_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p310_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p310_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p310_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p310_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p310_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p310_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p310_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p310_025|he was the youngest of the british team.
p310_026|i fell in love with the ballet.
p310_027|that their music is truly truly truly great.
p310_028|it feels like a winner already.
p310_029|did you see that?
p310_030|the merger was welcomed by tony blair.
p310_031|and the winners are.
p310_032|i can't believe something like this could happen.
p310_033|mr king who was present at yesterday's hearing refused to comment.
p310_034|he didn't really we just made that up.
p310_035|scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p310_036|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p310_037|it is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p310_038|we're still talking with a few people.
p310_039|but one shouldn't go by that.
p310_040|nothing is lost everything is recycled.
p310_041|buying our way out is not an option.
p310_042|there are big names.
p310_043|that argument has been won.
p310_044|normally they have been a pack of lies.
p310_045|he moved back to edinburgh where he lived with his mother.
p310_046|and who would argue with that?
p310_047|i hope you will leave it at that.
p310_048|we're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p310_049|they had four children together.
p310_050|again that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p310_051|lothian and borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p310_052|i fell to the ground.
p310_053|they said she had been visiting her son who is unemployed.
p310_054|they were not defeated.
p310_055|alcohol of course is strictly forbidden in iran.
p310_056|how can they engage with the work?
p310_057|all of us know it exists.
p310_058|moray council could not be contacted last night.
p310_059|this is the band.
p310_060|she has a wonderful mind.
p310_061|there are just two tournaments remaining.
p310_062|we're into that build up now.
p310_063|it is the end of an era.
p310_064|we shall not do that.
p310_065|i have had no social life at all.
p310_066|hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p310_067|once again he refused.
p310_068|this is about the orange order.
p310_069|in fact they will not be disciplined.
p310_070|we're not the tourist board.
p310_071|sub not used mckenzie.
p310_072|apart from that they would not be making any comment.
p310_073|the commons is too outdated.
p310_074|overall though it has been a pretty good week.
p310_075|that was then and this is now.
p310_076|both will be heard at glasgow sheriff court.
p310_077|europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p310_078|are you watching liverpool?
p310_079|he would be with his peers.
p310_080|they seem to be backing off from that.
p310_081|but it took a lot of bottle.
p310_082|they don't work anymore anyway.
p310_083|i wish they too would get a grip.
p310_084|i am so sorry.
p310_085|this avalanche is just beginning.
p310_086|journalists should make him.
p310_087|i believe we have a good chance.
p310_088|however it is no longer with the national team.
p310_089|she may even appear in some more films.
p310_090|this is the best moment of my career.
p310_091|he also called in at another farm.
p310_092|i don't know why she is not here.
p310_093|england could not take anything for granted however.
p310_094|i agree with them.
p310_095|i feel very strongly about that.
p310_096|now he will have to start again.
p310_097|it is a difficult thing to explain.
p310_098|i don't know how it happened.
p310_099|peter doesn't want to leave.
p310_100|after that nothing could save him.
p310_101|construction is due to begin in february.
p310_102|we shall rely on human beings.
p310_103|in fact that would be a distortion of the truth.
p310_104|he wouldn't allow that to happen.
p310_105|his treatment has been quite atrocious.
p310_106|it wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p310_107|or rather it isn't.
p310_108|the picture is the same across scotland.
p310_109|sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p310_110|my dad was working in ayrshire.
p310_111|there are lots of these women in finland.
p310_112|i will not be in dialogue with her.
p310_113|but there is another side.
p310_114|drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p310_115|there is no guarantee.
p310_116|i'm confident we can turn things around.
p310_117|we want to get to the final anyway.
p310_118|it may be argued.
p310_119|he is a close friend of gordon brown.
p310_120|i bought a car at auction.
p310_121|and who were they anyway beforehand?
p310_122|his three year appointment begins on monday.
p310_123|mr straw was home secretary at the time.
p310_124|five in a month isn't good enough.
p310_125|meanwhile rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p310_126|this is just one example.
p310_127|both offices were closed yesterday.
p310_128|they don't have to but they normally do.
p310_129|we stopped at half time.
p310_130|now though he is back playing superbly for blackburn.
p310_131|david was not either.
p310_132|britain may now be forced to listen.
p310_133|we don't see it as downgrading.
p310_134|he wanted someone young and ambitious.
p310_135|no date has been set for the appeal.
p310_136|he is dying from cancer.
p310_137|people can describe a moment in their life.
p310_138|what's the rush?
p310_139|the starting point is pretty unusual.
p310_140|however they will only be found in the wild.
p310_141|they receive a high profile in the media.
p310_142|it was an ambush.
p310_143|i think this proposal is excellent.
p310_144|if glasgow is so interested they have the right to bid.
p310_145|is that too much to ask?
p310_146|the pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p310_147|i've so much respect for him.
p310_148|each one has its own system.
p310_149|i felt under no pressure today.
p310_150|the devil is the creator of weapons.
p310_151|and that was the adults.
p310_152|last night however other experts were cautious about the claim.
p310_153|this is a job for the government.
p310_154|i felt the head was very like me.
p310_155|we started with that.
p310_156|and he had much need.
p310_157|last night the bombardment was terrible.
p310_158|this can only help us go forward.
p310_159|it's never the same problem.
p310_160|but even so you always want to try something new.
p310_161|jonny wilkinson had an off day on saturday.
p310_162|i hadn't been looking after myself.
p310_163|i was over the moon.
p310_164|and really the songs are the key thing.
p310_165|four minutes later the show was over.
p310_166|his arguments were supported by mr bevan.
p310_167|northern ireland is a society divided by religion.
p310_168|and then came the seventies.
p310_169|i guess it is down to focus.
p310_170|last week he was taken to the hospital.
p310_171|you can leave him knowing the job will be done.
p310_172|his track record is not promising.
p310_173|no one not even the scottish arts council was interested in her.
p310_174|he put a lot of effort into it.
p310_175|however you have just got to adjust it.
p310_176|that was moving the goalposts.
p310_177|he was pronounced dead in hospital.
p310_178|we have the location which is assured.
p310_179|the club are feeling no different today.
p310_180|what if the confession is after all a fake?
p310_181|i see the extended family once a year.
p310_182|i'm not a magician.
p310_183|we couldn't go very fast.
p310_185|there was even a joke.
p310_186|tony blair can you see her face?
p310_187|this guy is never going to give up.
p310_188|they had previously been on five day notice.
p310_189|but even without either glasgow will be outstanding.
p310_190|the show is small but perfectly formed.
p310_191|this is the first job of the director leadership.
p310_192|it's been very exciting very challenging and a privilege.
p310_193|it is too early to speculate.
p310_194|i just had so much fun.
p310_195|smuggling is an increasing problem for the government.
p310_196|i will wait until later.
p310_197|whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p310_198|she is however fully conscious and able to speak.
p310_199|or so we have long assumed.
p310_200|they responded with victories.
p310_201|that was the personal impulse.
p310_202|i wanted really to deal with two opposite energies.
p310_203|but first it goes out on tv.
p310_204|what is the truth about the cow?
p310_205|they will want to watch a winning team.
p310_206|i think it's awful.
p310_207|who is going to be penalised?
p310_208|this will be just another tax on motorists.
p310_209|i feel sorry for the reds.
p310_210|one must hope not
p310_211|he is a satan.
p310_212|just see where the blood is coming from.
p310_213|he is very unlikely to feature against ireland.
p310_214|in her opinion the rich are different.
p310_215|hopefully the whole of scottish rugby was paying attention.
p310_216|i'm back playing football which is what it's all about.
p310_217|there was no cohesion.
p310_218|he was jailed for five years.
p310_219|thankfully we have started to listen to our customers.
p310_220|we will not break even.
p310_221|we will look into it.
p310_222|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p310_223|but he's not afraid to take risks.
p310_224|some of his family still live there.
p310_225|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p310_226|however it very nearly went wrong.
p310_227|dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p310_228|things are moving together.
p310_229|i get to work with very good people.
p310_230|a quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p310_231|he must not be removed from office.
p310_232|building an underground for example has proved a nightmare.
p310_233|obviously someone is not doing their job properly.
p310_234|look at the table.
p310_235|this film will be totally awesome.
p310_236|i don't think the saudis will lay down.
p310_237|committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p310_238|last year was not a good year.
p310_239|it's a difficult job.
p310_240|we can't get over it.
p310_241|several hundred people attended yesterday.
p310_242|my preference is for the single vaccines.
p310_243|this represents a tough game for us.
p310_244|he saw it all as a big game.
p310_245|they are not an item.
p310_246|and thought we would get away with it.
p310_247|i can't wait for the outdoors.
p310_248|it's more like a labour party rally.
p310_249|staff should be paid for what they produce.
p310_250|i would urge the government to think again.
p310_251|it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p310_252|they were on holiday in egypt.
p310_253|i was happiest with my short game.
p310_254|we've got no plans with regard to recording but who knows?
p310_255|we went on to become very successful.
p310_256|investment in quality service and marketing were the only way forward.
p310_257|no is the answer to your first question.
p310_258|we certainly did enough to win it but didn't.
p310_259|that could be at least five years away.
p310_260|that is my role.
p310_261|he also presented you bet
p310_262|that's the day job.
p310_263|it really is taken seriously.
p310_264|we have not given up hope.
p310_265|i'm looking at ways to do that now.
p310_266|broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p310_267|it's such a trial
p310_268|that kind of growth is the important thing.
p310_269|i think it is totally wrong.
p310_270|and a film maker was born.
p310_271|it was also put on the internet.
p310_272|the reason is the thought of olympic gold.
p310_273|and yet his legacy is doubtful.
p310_274|it seems to have worked.
p310_275|top up fees are not on the agenda.
p310_276|there was a battle there.
p310_277|this he told the committee was not forthcoming.
p310_278|well when did he ever refuse?
p310_279|today's ruling confirms that.
p310_280|it's good news and long overdue.
p310_281|the atmosphere was electric.
p310_282|i'd never heard him in person before.
p310_283|we're going to change our party.
p310_284|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p310_285|i have learned a lot from him.
p310_286|is he any good in the kitchen?
p310_287|he has been campaigning for change for years.
p310_288|a formal decision will be announced within months.
p310_289|he must have something up his sleeve.
p310_290|he was at home with his pals.
p310_291|we make good weapons.
p310_292|so too eriksson as yet unbeaten on his travels with england.
p310_293|this is not a scottish problem.
p310_294|then followed a bout of flu.
p310_295|the balance isn't there at emi.
p310_296|that was the most annoying thing.
p310_297|we are being hijacked.
p310_298|we had no part in it.
p310_299|it wasn't so pathetic it would be funny.
p310_300|mike tyson went to prison.
p310_301|it was nice to get a clean sheet.
p310_302|our young people are leaving.
p310_303|and there is no cause for it.
p310_304|that would have been too easy.
p310_305|she admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p310_306|this is not a faceless system.
p310_307|this is a long term discussion paper.
p310_308|in all cases computer equipment was seized.
p310_309|it is just like the stock market.
p310_310|the damage from the fire was huge.
p310_311|that's what it's all about isn't it?
p310_312|both agreed on the success of the event.
p310_313|what then is the real thing?
p310_314|boarding school was equally protective.
p310_315|most people know that.
p310_316|it will be the final push.
p310_317|clearly this was the important nursing.
p310_318|others were in hiding in fear of their lives.
p310_319|the campaign was raucous.
p310_320|on saturday it was much the same.
p310_321|but both were involved with other matters.
p310_322|but we were wrong.
p310_323|the result today is an impasse.
p310_324|however in october another partnership was announced.
p310_325|there is no threat to them.
p310_326|nelson does not disappoint.
p310_327|the goal will stay with me forever.
p310_328|the pressure was now back on mr arafat.
p310_329|western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p310_330|it is a high time to act.
p310_331|then we will face the danish champions.
p310_332|he wins the match with a passionate committed almost demented display.
p310_333|the south african defended his work ethic.
p310_334|we have a team to reach the final.
p310_335|there was barely a handful of chances.
p310_336|the olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p310_337|i have found my vision.
p310_338|we don't know the scale of need.
p310_339|you need a reason for staying.
p310_340|quite simply for once in his life he got it wrong.
p310_341|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p310_342|i don't expect to see that this time.
p310_343|you are going to glasgow airport and not coming back.
p310_344|the big issue for us is the review.
p310_345|that is not the way we should operate.
p310_346|more likely perhaps it is that he will stay in england.
p310_347|the new work will begin in the autumn.
p310_348|the written judgment was issued in printed form.
p310_349|he showed he has some things to learn.
p310_350|or do they?
p310_351|they are the innocent victims.
p310_352|it is now time for justice.
p310_353|that is of no use.
p310_354|i could have been offended.
p310_355|now it is measuring it in dollars.
p310_356|but he is frustrated at every turn.
p310_357|he was down the right the left and through the middle.
p310_358|this is the lowest of the low.
p310_359|brian wilson in case you didn't know is a genius.
p310_360|clearly it is time to meet this young man.
p310_361|he's a nice guy.
p310_362|the milk industry is in turmoil.
p310_363|i love the moment of being first.
p310_364|it is a decision which has paid off.
p310_365|their mind was already made up.
p310_366|i had some time with aston villa.
p310_367|but it's got to be worth it.
p310_368|but does the same thing happen with music?
p310_369|i just couldn't believe what had happened.
p310_370|alex is a big part of that future.
p310_371|pray that is so.
p310_372|in fact it isn't related to either.
p310_373|there was support from across the board.
p310_374|there may be some evidence to this effect.
p310_375|it is playing long but it is also in beautiful condition.
p310_376|so what does one do?
p310_377|such actions are rarely popular.
p310_378|the methadone programme is completely out of control.
p310_379|that is why it's so lyrical.
p310_380|i joined a group.
p310_381|i've heard this stuff about the markets.
p310_382|it has the bank of scotland behind it.
p310_383|it has removed a bit of guilt.
p310_384|and they all had these other commitments.
p310_385|however there you have it success has eluded them so far.
p310_386|here again they were denied a voice.
p310_387|they were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
p310_388|last year however it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p310_389|i never agreed with that.
p310_390|i didn't actually believe them at first.
p310_391|have you heard anything from paramount?
p310_392|we knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
p310_393|we always thought it should be digital and cheap.
p310_394|there was only one hole in it.
p310_395|i don't think it's vital.
p310_396|it might not survive the process.
p310_397|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p310_398|my father died in childbirth.
p310_399|the issue has still to be resolved.
p310_400|which brings us to the scottish connection.
p310_401|it is a catalogue of obstruction.
p310_402|i'm happy to contribute to that.
p310_403|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p310_404|we were close but not close enough.
p310_405|and that started me thinking.
p310_406|offered the gold medal he declined.
p310_407|it brings together two essential elements.
p310_408|is it the players or is it the coaches?
p310_409|we had a reunion last week.
p310_410|this will help our confidence.
p310_411|we have high hopes that this will work.
p310_412|they also have good neighbours.
p310_413|people ask about the concept of a team.
p310_414|who has he fought?
p310_415|the film is about the cost of genius.
p310_416|they've been here before.
p310_417|i want a free vote.
p310_418|he came close to signing for rangers too.
p310_419|it would show them a positive way forward.
p310_420|i think it's a disgrace.
p310_421|so he should be.
p310_422|he also admitted possessing a firearm.
p310_423|all is busy but not much is happening.
p310_424|both reports appeared in the british medical journal.
p311_001|please call stella.
p311_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p311_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p311_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p311_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p311_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p311_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p311_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p311_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p311_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p311_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
p311_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p311_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p311_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p311_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p311_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p311_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p311_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p311_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p311_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p311_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p311_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p311_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p311_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p311_025|no sooner had we got it than we wanted it different.
p311_026|it's ahead of labour.
p311_027|it is the whole package.
p311_028|i was totally wrong.
p311_029|it was a matter of chance.
p311_030|strictly speaking it shouldn't be like this.
p311_031|miller was every bit as happy.
p311_032|we keep a distance.
p311_033|she went home from school and never returned.
p311_034|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p311_035|with actors it is slightly different.
p311_036|green is desperate to play in the open.
p311_037|they did a very good job.
p311_038|that's what we're still trying to do.
p311_039|he tried to stop it but it was already too late.
p311_040|we cannot go on in this fashion.
p311_041|we must learn to finish.
p311_042|there can be no two ways about it.
p311_043|i knew my contract was up this year.
p311_044|i am content with the silver.
p311_045|people acted too quickly.
p311_046|my heart is with the artist.
p311_047|that fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311_048|there are different cultures in different departments.
p311_049|what would you do if you didn't work?
p311_050|they are already on the way there.
p311_051|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p311_052|this is a holy place.
p311_053|we will miss him very much.
p311_054|as a nation we must become more active.
p311_055|they should go ahead as normal.
p311_056|at the moment michael is in a class of his own.
p311_057|it ended as it began in confusion.
p311_058|i just went a bit too far.
p311_059|i am delighted for simon.
p311_060|his third goal was superb.
p311_061|i don't have a problem with getting older.
p311_062|it has been declared.
p311_063|sure that already happens in new zealand.
p311_064|the scientific debate is dead.
p311_065|only one got through.
p311_066|in the end however it all came together.
p311_067|he is a visionary.
p311_068|i was the trial judge in both.
p311_069|i have a choice.
p311_070|it happens in many countries.
p311_071|it's not just about the shows.
p311_072|but the cost to his health was enormous.
p311_073|i have spoken to the skipper.
p311_074|already the children are dying.
p311_075|craig is a major concern for us.
p311_076|we don't do this for everyone of course.
p311_077|i can't wait to meet him.
p311_078|the pain was almost too much to bear.
p311_079|it's the same as glasgow.
p311_080|we've got a job to do.
p311_081|you just have to adjust.
p311_082|well that's just a third district.
p311_083|i've done nothing wrong and that's the truth.
p311_084|they are there to help us.
p311_085|he added we are not prepared for war.
p311_086|my wife and family are the support system.
p311_087|sub not used mcarthur.
p311_088|i have hardly any commitments.
p311_089|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p311_090|it is a very special place.
p311_091|some things in life you have to accept.
p311_092|i am relishing the challenge.
p311_093|it is set in paris.
p311_094|the party has never fully recovered.
p311_095|everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p311_096|surely history will not repeat itself.
p311_097|the initial report has been completed.
p311_098|he's got me very well.
p311_099|it's like an extension of your body.
p311_100|it is quite a new prescription.
p311_101|johnsen is equally concerned.
p311_102|which he is too.
p311_103|these matters are now behind us.
p311_104|but things are never the same again.
p311_105|it is easy to agree with him.
p311_106|he too will return.
p311_107|is there anything in the wound?
p311_108|chambers said he would accept the place.
p311_109|just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p311_110|it is not really used by many people.
p311_111|there could be no dispute about our history.
p311_112|he has one son and one daughter.
p311_113|don't get me wrong.
p311_114|it is nearly there.
p311_115|otherwise we will pay the price.
p311_116|i find it rather oppressive.
p311_117|they are all arabs.
p311_118|it is already making a difference.
p311_119|he decides to do something about it.
p311_120|there were no new cases yesterday.
p311_121|someone else has now got them.
p311_122|but once again it was not converted.
p311_123|these figures are truly terrible.
p311_124|this is a most serious matter.
p311_125|i let go the telephone and ran.
p311_126|everyone at the school is delighted for steven.
p311_127|after that the scottish parliament will run the show.
p311_128|it was a bit of a shock.
p311_129|the hearing was continued until a later date.
p311_130|still some additions are inspired.
p311_131|planning is a key issue.
p311_132|did he always want to be a comedian?
p311_133|the way ahead is not easy.
p311_134|i could do a better job.
p311_135|yet what is supposed to be said?
p311_136|parole isn't a decision for me.
p311_137|i get the bus.
p311_138|we are still the best team in britain.
p311_139|they got the job done.
p311_140|it's a horrific incident.
p311_141|they have been contrasting years certainly.
p311_142|four minutes later the show was over.
p311_143|we've not won anything yet.
p311_144|they failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p311_145|there was only one problem the teacher was still there
p311_146|they did not let him down.
p311_147|i believe in trade unions.
p311_148|this is in a league of its own.
p311_149|it's been such a waste of money.
p311_150|the money is not really our concern.
p311_151|you just know it.
p311_152|now she has completed a family tradition.
p311_153|i certainly think it's very short sighted.
p311_154|we have the easy part.
p311_155|at westminster there was disbelief at the news.
p311_156|it's like a high school play.
p311_157|he was part of south africa.
p311_158|it's there for people to look at.
p311_159|the party will make up its own mind.
p311_160|at least two women were among those arrested.
p311_161|they never got into the show this time.
p311_162|but no it's not funny.
p311_163|in that case the children were not missing.
p311_164|he changed my life.
p311_165|there was nothing else to match it.
p311_166|two options are being proposed.
p311_167|they haven't been thought through.
p311_168|the criteria have changed.
p311_169|o is there a lot of blood?
p311_170|willie deserved it for what he has achieved.
p311_171|i've thought a lot about the commonwealths.
p311_172|he was at home with his pals.
p311_173|this is a very interesting move.
p311_174|the highest rate is in glasgow.
p311_175|his only reply was a laugh.
p311_176|those who are preparing to give up.
p311_177|what kind of festival is proposed?
p311_178|i was delighted with every one of them.
p311_179|sure the coe is a cracking band.
p311_180|finally they have a journey back to their youth.
p311_181|that will help my case a bit.
p311_182|it was entirely justified.
p311_183|he looked at me before replying.
p311_184|this may be perfectly innocent.
p311_185|it feels that the game is off.
p311_186|there will be no change in government.
p311_187|another man said it was horrible.
p311_188|but we still don't know.
p311_189|who do you think you are?
p311_190|glasgow is a tour de force.
p311_191|i have no battle with the scots.
p311_192|it is all credit to them today.
p311_193|i have done ever since it was published.
p311_194|nobody could survive on that.
p311_195|they seem to turn up for them.
p311_196|they were kept there for a summer.
p311_197|he confirmed there had been no warning.
p311_198|it is that sort of film.
p311_199|she was not hard done by.
p311_200|can you believe it?
p311_201|i want the commonwealth and european titles.
p311_202|they are now out in the cold.
p311_203|however planners should be taking the lead.
p311_204|i'm very frightened of the dark.
p311_205|our message was inclusive.
p311_206|this has been a shock.
p311_207|yet the survey has been cautious.
p311_208|everything in the symphony is there.
p311_209|there has also been some scots input.
p311_210|this time he will be more on the defensive.
p311_211|there is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p311_212|but who will buy it?
p311_213|it had to be more flexible.
p311_214|openness is always the best way.
p311_215|it wouldn't go off.
p311_216|it can be halted.
p311_217|this was a lot of numbers.
p311_218|would it be good for the nationwide league?
p311_219|last night she refused to comment on the accident.
p311_220|the whole thing has been a nightmare.
p311_221|he denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p311_222|the professor said the results were positive.
p311_223|i think he's the favourite no question.
p311_224|but it's just great to have won.
p311_225|and it paid off.
p311_226|gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p311_227|those were the days indeed.
p311_228|i never made any offer to mark.
p311_229|it should be scrapped.
p311_230|he admitted the asylum system was not working.
p311_231|they are just trying to cover up.
p311_232|we have to defend ourselves.
p311_233|i came here this week to work.
p311_234|where do we go from here?
p311_235|barry ferguson is one of them.
p311_236|he gets his moment.
p311_237|this was an option from the beginning.
p311_238|clearly he is keeping in touch.
p311_239|it's not a party no no.
p311_240|it's not that clear cut.
p311_241|it may not be life long.
p311_242|it was just above the roof.
p311_243|it has changed and not for the better.
p311_244|however that is a sizeable if.
p311_245|everyone must be focused on the league.
p311_246|the english are coming.
p311_247|i believe in theatre.
p311_248|only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p311_249|however many of their victories have been close affairs.
p311_250|it's time to say enough is enough.
p311_251|mentally you have to be tough.
p311_252|he has to pull back from the brink.
p311_253|she has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p311_254|that's my daughter acting.
p311_255|the film has also been superbly designed.
p311_256|the performance was really really immense.
p311_257|faces from the eighties.
p311_258|the family baton is handed on.
p311_259|how can this be?
p311_260|we are still alive and kicking.
p311_261|i want to go now.
p311_262|there are many questions to be answered.
p311_263|our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p311_264|all the children on the roll are genuine.
p311_265|they said we were out of touch.
p311_266|sub not used mccormick.
p311_267|there is no signature.
p311_268|there is no point in denying that.
p311_269|the kids are paying the price.
p311_270|he said he was delighted by the award.
p311_271|they didn't find any substance.
p311_272|they still have the dirty work to do.
p311_273|i've never seen a game like it.
p311_274|it doesn't seem like that long ago.
p311_275|he will do very well.
p311_276|they also intend to travel today.
p311_277|there's a lot of hysteria.
p311_278|the casualties were not named.
p311_279|i was shaking on the blocks.
p311_280|there are two ways to start a festival.
p311_281|i am very happy with life.
p311_282|awareness in europe of scotland is high.
p311_283|my office is down there.
p311_284|even then this game was not over.
p311_285|seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
p311_286|we also hope to meet the men.
p311_287|the defender made an impressive debut.
p311_288|it has become very confused.
p311_289|fame and money followed.
p311_290|i am not in denial.
p311_291|shelter also supports the reform.
p311_292|the attack was totally out of the blue.
p311_293|there is a solution she believes.
p311_294|so there is a very real dilemma.
p311_295|i can't believe we didn't win that game.
p311_296|then there's the old firm.
p311_297|i seem to keep this for the majors.
p311_298|we were in different places usually in cellars.
p311_299|they're not always the same person.
p311_300|it would have to be backdated.
p311_301|he said he was sorry.
p311_302|my position on the euro is quite clear.
p311_303|well it did last time he was reminded.
p311_304|we have worked well with them for years.
p311_305|that was me today.
p311_306|that is the consistent approach of the government.
p311_307|that is when we are really effective.
p311_308|the director's a genius.
p311_309|there was no sign that anything was amiss.
p311_310|it was the climax of the thing.
p311_311|this is new money.
p311_312|we have not given up on the game.
p311_313|the decision was left entirely to him.
p311_314|yes it was uplifting.
p311_315|nobody should believe this story.
p311_316|this is not out of choice.
p311_317|but don't just take my word for it.
p311_318|but this one has a lot of potential.
p311_319|it's a big challenge for the audience.
p311_320|we'll see what happens.
p311_321|this was another video cassette.
p311_322|if that is the perception that has to be addressed.
p311_323|it will make a huge difference.
p311_324|he pretended not to care.
p311_325|not because they want to sing about something.
p311_326|i was in tears in the street.
p311_327|eriksson though was having none of it.
p311_328|no doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p311_329|but that's not the idea behind this article.
p311_330|if he could've prevented it happening he would have.
p311_331|that is why we are here.
p311_332|the german had a point to make.
p311_333|this time however may have been different.
p311_334|you have to feel for the guy.
p311_335|however the second goal was about to be delivered.
p311_336|bomber was not amused.
p311_337|they would have been forgiven for doing so.
p311_338|was it just negligent.
p311_339|and suddenly it became a free for all.
p311_340|this government is cutting taxes.
p311_341|things don't look too good at the moment.
p311_342|this is a big club.
p311_343|i couldn't quite believe it and still can't.
p311_344|they will now get that support.
p311_345|i feel it's time to make the switch.
p311_346|it seemed so personal.
p311_347|i've no problem with what they said.
p311_348|he added that he felt undermined.
p311_349|i think we have got the balance right.
p311_350|eriksson would have approved.
p311_351|it is physical but it is also good.
p311_352|his behaviour today has been disgusting.
p311_353|tyson said he had made a mistake.
p311_354|so it goes on.
p311_355|we think a lot of allan mcgregor.
p311_356|i hope they will understand the reasons.
p311_357|they should have listened to me.
p311_358|i am greatly encouraged.
p311_359|it was like someone had died.
p311_360|what does he want him to look like?
p311_361|the actors are confident and polished.
p311_362|i hope he would have been very pleased.
p311_363|we would have concerns about that.
p311_364|taxes may need to rise.
p311_365|it's unusual to say the least.
p311_366|all inquiries should be made to the police.
p311_367|our great depression is our lives.
p311_368|i just did not cope with the pressure.
p311_369|we have some concerns.
p311_370|so he was anxious to try something new.
p311_371|this was a chilling echo.
p311_372|they really want to do it.
p311_373|and then he laughs.
p311_374|i recommend a tour.
p311_375|we don't ask for much.
p311_376|we owe it to the public of strathclyde.
p311_377|i had a wonderful time working with him.
p311_378|we have to start again on saturday.
p311_379|it feels like a winner already.
p311_380|and it covers the spectrum.
p311_381|the replacements made a big difference.
p311_382|and the winners are.
p311_383|thankfully that doesn't happen that often.
p311_384|he didn't really we just made that up.
p311_385|scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p311_386|there are big names.
p311_387|my players are precious to me.
p311_388|that argument has been won.
p311_389|normally they have been a pack of lies.
p311_390|for us that decision was hard to understand.
p311_391|i had to calm down.
p311_392|lothian and borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p311_393|she returned home a few days later.
p311_394|they haven't run away.
p311_395|nobody can take it away from me.
p311_396|she is fulfilled by it.
p311_397|he said no survivors had been found.
p311_398|who can say?
p311_399|it is the end of an era.
p311_400|in short the club was broke.
p311_401|sadly in this case that was not so.
p311_402|she is a veteran in the balkans.
p311_403|the men are safe and unharmed.
p311_404|we're not the tourist board.
p311_405|it was the same old story.
p311_406|i was frustrated here.
p311_407|we have reacted well to each other.
p311_408|are you watching liverpool?
p311_409|i was furious about it.
p311_410|this will be no easy option.
p311_411|they knew they shouldn't have been there.
p311_412|of course we aren't.
p311_413|we haven't been told.
p311_414|it worked well in monaco.
p311_415|they were outside the circle.
p311_416|the whole process was so different.
p311_417|he also called in at another farm.
p311_418|i agree with them.
p311_419|i feel very strongly about that.
p311_420|we will listen to colleagues.
p311_421|it's very difficult and very worrying.
p311_422|it's something we want to make work.
p311_423|there will be no excuses on wednesday.
p312_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p312_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p312_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p312_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p312_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p312_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p312_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p312_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p312_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p312_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p312_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p312_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p312_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p312_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p312_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p312_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p312_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p312_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p312_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
p312_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
p312_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p312_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p312_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p312_025|perhaps that was their mistake.
p312_026|this was a rationing decision.
p312_027|the way forward is working with other disciplines.
p312_028|he is doing the right things.
p312_029|blood samples were taken.
p312_030|i've got the poster.
p312_031|this is excellent news for the workforce.
p312_032|we have a high quality product.
p312_033|haven't been so lucky since.
p312_034|well you might have a point.
p312_035|it was quite distressing for the crew.
p312_036|now the show is for public consumption.
p312_037|that decision is now being appealed.
p312_038|this is really good news for us.
p312_039|i wish it wasn't so but it is.
p312_040|not so it transpires.
p312_041|i shouldn't have put up with it.
p312_042|i think so he seems to be in good health.
p312_043|i think it must be the uniforms.
p312_044|this is not a monument to the past.
p312_045|i certainly hope not.
p312_046|however there could be more bad weather to come.
p312_047|i feel pretty good.
p312_048|the group will report back in the summer.
p312_049|back then it was hard to refuse.
p312_050|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p312_051|i was in the zone in the morning.
p312_052|we have to break that cycle.
p312_053|in fact it might just be the beginning.
p312_054|the children are being very brave.
p312_055|they have a car and cannot afford another.
p312_056|my only concern is for my children.
p312_057|this is welcome news.
p312_058|the criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p312_059|the trust has no magic wand.
p312_060|we just wish they had done so before.
p312_061|it was a virus.
p312_062|the rest of course is history.
p312_063|they chose the latter.
p312_064|i've not said anything to them they know.
p312_065|all were later allowed home.
p312_066|will you just put it away?
p312_067|i think it's more important to have fun.
p312_068|who did the recruiting?
p312_069|it is still with ministers.
p312_070|the effect was almost magical.
p312_071|it happened again and again and again.
p312_072|it showed him the way to drive.
p312_073|i am still waiting for a reply.
p312_074|after this they were always in the driving seat.
p312_075|were they under age?
p312_076|he was charged with perjury.
p312_077|i started it but then forgot all about it.
p312_078|however there would be no permanent displays.
p312_079|the goal will come.
p312_080|he could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312_081|we didn't take our chances.
p312_082|it was all very proper and civilised.
p312_083|i've played them all in the champions league.
p312_084|there are many children.
p312_085|that never seemed likely.
p312_086|action must be taken urgently.
p312_087|i was brought up in a mining background.
p312_088|either system could have prevented the crash.
p312_089|here the fans have been fantastic.
p312_090|i thought his speech was a disgrace.
p312_091|but these things are happening now.
p312_092|i am very encouraged by this poll.
p312_093|they should be swept away.
p312_094|they thought the set up there was unfair.
p312_095|it will be a challenging film.
p312_096|the test case is still awaiting action.
p312_097|what happens next?
p312_098|he added the old system has reached its limits.
p312_099|we could easily be cut again.
p312_100|the plot is minimal.
p312_101|the scheme is hopelessly failing.
p312_102|they're just a nonsense.
p312_103|there may be some resistance.
p312_104|i could not believe it.
p312_105|one letter from a teacher arrived at christmas.
p312_106|the rangers think they have problems.
p312_107|he will go a long way.
p312_108|then there was her childhood.
p312_109|hopefully he will get a lucky break.
p312_110|i thought that all musicians were the same.
p312_111|it's so much more fun.
p312_112|i believe he could have turned it around.
p312_113|secondly there are other options for patients.
p312_114|where do you think she is going?
p312_115|this looks like it's anything but open.
p312_116|i am not against a further inquiry.
p312_117|such is the scene of the tragedy.
p312_118|it's a double whammy.
p312_119|what's the theme?
p312_120|we are satisfied that this is the case.
p312_121|for me it was a shattering experience.
p312_122|this latter suggestion is very important.
p312_123|the deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p312_124|davis is very supportive as a director.
p312_125|there was some merit in that.
p312_126|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p312_127|what's wrong with that?
p312_128|the pain is still acute.
p312_129|his remit is specific.
p312_130|it is a very big problem.
p312_131|frustration is not the word.
p312_132|the police have to act to help them.
p312_133|she was extremely rigid.
p312_134|it may be down but new york is not out.
p312_135|but what lies ahead?
p312_136|i am so upset.
p312_137|i was blown out of proportion.
p312_138|there was a definite prejudice.
p312_139|it's the same with us.
p312_140|it's an awful lot of money.
p312_141|he was the architect.
p312_142|this should include procedures for personal imports.
p312_143|it's a fantastic achievement.
p312_144|neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p312_145|he too was not satisfied.
p312_146|it's easy to see why.
p312_147|i've never regretted coming here.
p312_148|he is in a lot of pain it's very distressing.
p312_149|i am so so so lucky.
p312_150|we still have a long long way to go.
p312_151|i fell into it by accident.
p312_152|i only wanted to give her a fright.
p312_153|where does it come from?
p312_154|norman was not doing so bad either.
p312_155|if you have to pay for treatment you pay for treatment.
p312_156|it is almost certain to be the last.
p312_157|britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p312_158|that says something for his strength of character.
p312_159|the world is being invited to visit.
p312_160|if it's not they didn't go far enough.
p312_161|i think it's a sensible change.
p312_162|sex is fun?
p312_163|i'm not sure.
p312_164|his first album was a hit.
p312_165|he had played well in that central role.
p312_166|and who would argue with that?
p312_167|it was visibly on fire.
p312_168|what's it for after all?
p312_169|who would be out there singing?
p312_170|a number of people could not speak english.
p312_171|they have got off with murder.
p312_172|charges against the pair were found not proven.
p312_173|this remains the party's policy.
p312_174|i cannot say anymore.
p312_175|they want this research to continue.
p312_176|robert is a special talent.
p312_177|they are going to carry it through.
p312_178|it was very very dejected.
p312_179|you can't keep them separate.
p312_180|i think it can count against you now.
p312_181|he was a legend.
p312_182|that's when the story first appeared.
p312_183|you're going to die.
p312_184|there was a substantial explosion.
p312_185|he will continue to provide support for them.
p312_186|i'm going to see my friend.
p312_187|we played too deeply.
p312_188|i probably would have been a dancer.
p312_189|there is a lot of heroin about.
p312_190|we're going to see a government in a hurry.
p312_191|he never asked me for money.
p312_192|i was a bit nervous.
p312_193|there was no question of him not impressing.
p312_194|however we came through.
p312_195|i love this tournament.
p312_196|he had a heart problem.
p312_197|i am desperate to play for scotland.
p312_198|it is a large number.
p312_199|we felt at the moment it was not possible.
p312_200|hear what they have to say.
p312_201|now there's a thought.
p312_202|i believe that the answer is simple.
p312_203|that he claimed was essential.
p312_204|i was on the pitch and everything.
p312_205|they told him to go to drama school.
p312_206|clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p312_207|let us hope so.
p312_208|she looked very settled.
p312_209|of course he was right
p312_210|the next few months will tell.
p312_211|it felt like my support system was leaving.
p312_212|but my daughter has got nothing.
p312_213|you can see their point.
p312_214|nobody if he has anything to do with it.
p312_215|the dangers are very obvious.
p312_216|there were no casualties.
p312_217|is it in the right place?
p312_218|i played well in my time there.
p312_219|a teacher is really about unity.
p312_220|they are still going to be impulsive.
p312_221|i love you so very much.
p312_222|the scheme was simple but extremely effective.
p312_223|he is a very nice man.
p312_224|we want to sort it out.
p312_225|sean connery did not disappoint.
p312_226|such a city does not exist.
p312_227|it made me determined to get back.
p312_228|it was no avail.
p312_229|we're going to see more extreme weather.
p312_230|he was replaced by john spencer.
p312_231|of course we have to be very concerned about that.
p312_232|that is in the very nature of farming.
p312_233|and also when he does not have the ball.
p312_234|it was worth the wait.
p312_235|i love the tradition of vaudeville.
p312_236|it will take place in july.
p312_237|we must not give in to the bastards.
p312_238|this is a major step forward for carers.
p312_239|i think it was his parents.
p312_240|our commitment is to move forward.
p312_241|partly it is his own fault.
p312_242|it's a personal matter.
p312_243|that's where it all started.
p312_244|i won't go back.
p312_245|why has it taken so long?
p312_246|you make the choice.
p312_247|and does it?
p312_248|i was proud of our lads.
p312_249|these will finally be corrected by next week.
p312_250|this kind of traffic is commonplace.
p312_251|all would be under threat.
p312_252|was it a foul?
p312_253|he leaves a beat.
p312_254|perhaps it was her demeanour.
p312_255|it lasted longer than we thought.
p312_256|promises were not kept.
p312_257|it hasn't happened but other things have.
p312_258|the claim was denied by first minister.
p312_259|who is he?
p312_260|it has to be long term commitment.
p312_261|it was that bad that low.
p312_262|that would be a big mistake.
p312_263|his arrival could be the making of them.
p312_264|after all this is the start of the giving age.
p312_265|i said how much?
p312_266|you are a liar.
p312_267|the scheme has been funded by the government.
p312_268|we're still talking about it.
p312_269|she would say he was still the best.
p312_270|he finished the night in a cell.
p312_271|i'm not afraid of that.
p312_272|i don't know what he was shouting.
p312_273|it is the icing on the cake.
p312_274|it was a new ball game.
p312_275|the people here are quite reserved.
p312_276|previously police had said that schools were safe.
p312_277|our legal advice is clear.
p312_278|the past is history not destiny.
p312_279|these were the edited highlights.
p312_280|all were within range of israeli cities.
p312_281|they were totally behind it.
p312_282|however it is believed they were from the highlands.
p312_283|we could do a lot worse.
p312_284|knowledge is everything at this level.
p312_285|inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
p312_286|it is all one sided.
p312_287|in the end that was enough to beat england.
p312_288|that was the initial attraction.
p312_289|who will take them after that?
p312_290|he's also thinking long term.
p312_291|a kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
p312_292|trevor has been great.
p312_293|it would also take time.
p312_294|rather than answer she resigned.
p312_295|she said no he's not in elgin today.
p312_296|i was first in the door.
p312_297|it is highly unlikely.
p312_298|bill is a mentor.
p312_299|the atmosphere is businesslike.
p312_300|i have fallen in love with the highlands.
p312_301|there will be no exceptions to this rule.
p312_302|what makes a house a home?
p312_303|destruction came from within.
p312_304|i think however he was having a fit
p312_305|it is good to look back.
p312_306|you can't do one without the other.
p312_307|obviously we want to stop the rot.
p312_308|chris paterson was outstanding.
p312_309|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p312_310|i would say so.
p312_311|it's not the end of the matter of course.
p312_312|sub not used mckay.
p312_313|and they did just that.
p312_314|you have friends in the liberal democrats.
p312_315|she has left the island.
p312_316|they had three children.
p312_317|our system is archaic.
p312_318|she had kept the news from him.
p312_319|we want to know about the policy.
p312_320|it is not illegal.
p312_321|i wouldn't say this is normal.
p312_322|we don't have the credible evidence.
p312_323|that will be the case on tuesday.
p312_324|it's one up to the scots.
p312_325|this is complete nonsense.
p312_326|i don't want to use the term.
p312_327|there is still hope.
p312_328|it has the bank of scotland behind it.
p312_329|it's all happening at a local level.
p312_330|she is a great talent.
p312_331|it's the big omission.
p312_332|we do things in an appropriate way.
p312_334|however she is female and so.
p312_335|the playing is perfectly turned out.
p312_336|he will be advised by me.
p312_337|but he did not rule out further talks.
p312_338|it's part of your life.
p312_339|he had a horror.
p312_340|we're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p312_341|this time we may not be seeking volunteers.
p312_342|that was the biggest game of my life.
p312_343|this is perfectly legal.
p312_344|that's the most important thing for me.
p312_345|then came the second round.
p312_346|quite simply no one else is willing to do so.
p312_347|saddam is not threatening this country.
p312_348|we told them in june.
p312_349|parents should avoid it.
p312_350|it was not a difficult decision he said.
p312_351|it was a horrible thing to happen.
p312_352|and she's not even in the book
p312_353|of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p312_354|i feel really sorry for the iraqi people.
p312_355|he too is killing.
p312_356|bin laden is believed to be left handed.
p312_357|it's better to be happy.
p312_358|it's just so sad.
p312_359|we have lost the round but not the fight.
p312_360|and scotland is no different.
p312_361|it's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
p312_362|we are in a learning curve.
p312_363|he can do everything.
p312_364|she was just that sort of person.
p312_365|is it a warning to parents?
p312_366|you've gotten all the facts.
p312_367|and it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p312_368|soon the whole country will be level.
p312_369|and huge indeed it is.
p312_370|i'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p312_371|attack appears to be the biggest concern.
p312_372|for his opposite number this was a just triumph.
p312_373|he said he needed no more evidence.
p312_374|it's such a tragedy.
p312_375|it was a long time coming.
p312_376|gordon brown was superb.
p312_377|the referee didn't do his job.
p312_378|we are very nearly there.
p312_379|stand by for action.
p312_380|barry will be able to handle this.
p312_381|however this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p312_382|the urgency is real.
p312_383|they have been for some time now.
p312_384|it was only logical to end it.
p312_385|yet the consensus is it's worth it.
p312_386|i've no passion for any country.
p312_387|scotland needs to hear it too.
p312_388|nobody ever gets to see them.
p312_389|that's an old idea.
p312_390|it is part and parcel of it.
p312_391|the only safe investment is cash.
p312_392|it's the whole season.
p312_393|we had no choice but to go down.
p312_394|we are keen to have him back.
p312_395|this isn't something the labour government has invented.
p312_396|of course it was very passionate in glasgow.
p312_397|and we all understand that.
p312_398|the new incitement offence will cover all religions.
p312_399|clearly the future remains uncertain.
p312_400|do what you have to do.
p312_401|we must do well in that.
p312_402|she died later on monday.
p312_403|no one has yet been charged.
p312_404|if so they were wrong.
p312_405|this is my big break.
p312_406|it was meant to rival the dollar.
p312_407|there is no easy answer.
p312_408|there was someone on the floor.
p312_409|i put pressure on him.
p312_410|he supported the decision to review the decision.
p312_411|it was chaotic and frightening.
p312_412|friday night was a pretty good night.
p312_413|he will never walk the streets again.
p312_414|the proposals have been taken out of context.
p312_415|golf has lost a great character.
p312_416|however it has had only a limited uptake.
p312_417|i have to say for me the game was not.
p312_418|however the report was incorrect.
p312_419|there was no pressure at all.
p313_001|please call stella.
p313_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p313_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p313_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p313_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p313_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p313_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p313_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p313_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p313_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p313_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p313_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p313_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p313_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p313_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p313_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p313_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p313_018|aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p313_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p313_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p313_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
p313_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super imposition of a number of bows.
p313_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p313_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p313_025|they will be dealt with.
p313_026|it is never an easy game.
p313_027|this year it will be billy crystal.
p313_028|i intend to raise the matter there.
p313_029|however it's good to turn the page.
p313_030|we have to put this behind us.
p313_031|i thought it was quite good.
p313_032|it was important to win the singles.
p313_033|this is a disaster averted for scotland.
p313_034|that is impressive by any standards.
p313_035|we are doing very well as we are.
p313_036|the waiting is over well almost.
p313_037|this was the performance and the result they needed.
p313_038|i'm not allowed to say that of course.
p313_039|it helped me to get noticed.
p313_040|they hit me in the head.
p313_041|but he is not using them.
p313_042|that though was just the start of it.
p313_043|we are not moving in.
p313_044|we have not had a formal request.
p313_045|i never had a childhood.
p313_046|its effect on humans is not yet known.
p313_047|we offered something different.
p313_048|we were very much a happy family.
p313_049|he was critically ill in hospital last night.
p313_050|my brother's buried under there.
p313_051|their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p313_052|what were they?
p313_053|it was large enough to fit the wall.
p313_054|he will be judged by his actions.
p313_055|her role in it was small.
p313_056|i've really noticed that this week.
p313_057|we might be back next year.
p313_058|in a way he was.
p313_059|it's back to how it used to be.
p313_060|it is not a standing army.
p313_061|the firm was down and almost out.
p313_062|they said they were only young men.
p313_063|i was chosen to do this.
p313_064|i learned a lot from that.
p313_065|the house was so well alight.
p313_066|he got his degree.
p313_067|sandy was very active.
p313_068|however there is great potential in this right.
p313_069|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p313_070|i'm confident of the outcome this week.
p313_071|there were no formal announcements.
p313_072|before the games it was pretty open.
p313_073|it really has left the town in shock.
p313_074|but you can go beyond that condition.
p313_075|i'm so worried about the roads.
p313_076|this was much worse.
p313_077|he was convicted at glasgow sheriff court.
p313_078|we are confident of taking that back.
p313_079|they must be kept on the ground.
p313_080|did they give any good advice?
p313_081|who wants to be a millionaire?
p313_082|this does not help.
p313_083|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p313_084|that's why the ministers resigned.
p313_085|he has lost confidence and weight.
p313_086|this process of attrition is expected to continue.
p313_087|dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p313_088|this could be her way forward.
p313_089|this gives us a lot of practice.
p313_090|the parliament will make its own decisions.
p313_091|it's a very very special day.
p313_092|the crucial strike was yet to come.
p313_093|there's also the point.
p313_094|it was forced to divert.
p313_095|of course we know them from their work in the theatre.
p313_096|that's the national grid.
p313_097|but allen is deadly serious.
p313_098|peter doesn't want to leave.
p313_099|he wouldn't allow that to happen.
p313_100|they've just got to believe in themselves.
p313_101|this is my personal assessment.
p313_102|there was no trouble at all.
p313_103|although you never know.
p313_104|we shall be victorious.
p313_105|the quality of work is very impressive.
p313_106|however he added there were signs of progress.
p313_107|pitt of course would play the lead singer.
p313_108|i think the scottish bid is very strong.
p313_109|nothing is being offered in exchange.
p313_110|i took the gun.
p313_111|it's just one of those things.
p313_112|a web site is planned for november.
p313_113|we played so well at times.
p313_114|i was very fortunate.
p313_115|such a policy would be a disaster.
p313_116|we act because we must.
p313_117|they will be destroyed.
p313_118|we didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p313_119|o neill is reputed to have replied.
p313_120|the tory party will last.
p313_121|it was a journey into a new life.
p313_122|it's a way of making a mark.
p313_123|there is a great carry over value.
p313_124|life as many people know it in other words.
p313_125|i was a spectator that is as far as it goes.
p313_126|what's the point?
p313_127|why is this?
p313_128|what has changed since then?
p313_129|raymond was always on the outside.
p313_130|we need to make more inquiries about that.
p313_131|i'd love to be at the world cup.
p313_132|he is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p313_133|i'm sorry to hear this news.
p313_134|at some point the bill will be presented.
p313_135|i mean it happens.
p313_136|this week is a perfect example.
p313_137|this performance has given my confidence a boost.
p313_138|receiving this medal is an honour.
p313_139|sub not used mcculloch.
p313_140|but every two minutes it was exploding.
p313_141|that sort of thing is long gone.
p313_142|it's typical of me.
p313_143|however consumers may take a different view.
p313_144|they played it like a cup final.
p313_145|however it's not all bad news for women.
p313_146|but the championship is not over yet.
p313_147|we haven't found out anything different.
p313_148|a review of the decision is being sought.
p313_149|it will be about commitment not compliance.
p313_150|still in the end it was a fair result.
p313_151|surely it can do better than that?
p313_152|i am ashamed of them.
p313_153|glasgow however did not get a mention.
p313_154|the salary changes are long overdue.
p313_155|i like an idiot agreed.
p313_156|if so we want to hear from them.
p313_157|i'm not blaming audiences.
p313_158|who was on the panel?
p313_159|they may differ on other issues.
p313_160|he'd never run the distance before.
p313_161|i can make one further announcement.
p313_162|the general election is all to play for.
p313_163|it was a fiery game.
p313_164|agents and coaches must be paid.
p313_165|golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p313_166|obviously a lot has changed for me since then.
p313_167|it will not be easy for him.
p313_168|this one is a special case.
p313_169|but what are the songs about?
p313_170|there is a simmering anger out there.
p313_171|the ministers are now to make their decision.
p313_172|that is not a position they enjoy.
p313_173|the stadium was full.
p313_174|dewar is the medium.
p313_175|it was that kind of night.
p313_176|it is very much a matter for them.
p313_177|perhaps it is jealousy.
p313_178|any error is severely punished.
p313_179|he's got a great chance of making it.
p313_180|we won't do that.
p313_181|i hope we do.
p313_182|from now on there is no hiding place.
p313_183|i didn't want to ignore the punters.
p313_184|he quit in october.
p313_185|the united nations must act.
p313_186|sponsors include the sunday herald.
p313_187|her daughter is getting married.
p313_188|his manager blamed the referee.
p313_189|they were that poor.
p313_190|patients will be partners in decision making.
p313_191|we have understood the problems for some time.
p313_192|stan is a vital part of our future.
p313_193|all these things have an impact.
p313_194|that will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p313_195|they believed it worked.
p313_196|after that though we're still waiting to see.
p313_197|they should feel ashamed.
p313_198|this is a really serious issue.
p313_199|so they will settle again.
p313_200|how do we get more people in?
p313_201|i'm just looking to take my chances.
p313_202|it looks as though there is no chance.
p313_203|this is not a european army.
p313_204|election results are expected soon.
p313_205|so she told him.
p313_206|a contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p313_207|there are moments of honesty too.
p313_208|it was good to score the goal today.
p313_209|the night is young.
p313_210|sadly too many of them are similar.
p313_211|i suspect that it will.
p313_212|but there's no eye contact.
p313_213|the squad will be the same for france.
p313_214|we are a party for people not against people.
p313_215|bill clinton always had an idea to sell.
p313_216|we're still paying the price for that.
p313_217|he did his best but it wasn't good enough.
p313_218|it's not a wish list.
p313_219|he's very very lucky to be alive.
p313_220|some of the players have not progressed.
p313_221|it sounds like an appalling tragic incident.
p313_222|if not he should go home.
p313_223|we remain committed to it as does the government.
p313_224|there is no margin for error.
p313_225|this was not an easy meeting for me.
p313_226|from our point of view it's the right time.
p313_227|that figure will always remain with me.
p313_228|and then a funny thing happened.
p313_229|it doesn't take much.
p313_230|she asked us a lot of questions.
p313_231|it was a stunning strike.
p313_232|it is a technique.
p313_233|they hold on for many years.
p313_234|is it the shape of things to come?
p313_235|my body is exhausted.
p313_236|home is in the scottish borders.
p313_237|we have the support of scottish natural heritage.
p313_238|there is nothing to fear.
p313_239|i was an athlete.
p313_240|life was like a timetable.
p313_241|world leaders expressed their sympathy.
p313_242|i tried to push him away.
p313_243|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p313_244|this was done by the council staff.
p313_245|the truth is otherwise.
p313_246|we haven't come out of this very well.
p313_247|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p313_248|i thought they could have made the gesture.
p313_249|we should be rewarded for producing.
p313_250|the bottom line is that this must stop.
p313_251|which in effect it is.
p313_252|the man became a reporter.
p313_253|it is a memorial.
p313_254|we feel it sends out the wrong message.
p313_255|our people are paying high prices.
p313_256|the reason is partly because of tradition.
p313_257|nor is it likely to do so.
p313_258|or so everyone believed.
p313_259|perhaps we should do the same.
p313_260|i read it every year.
p313_261|he was in contention almost every week.
p313_262|every school in scotland should be excellent.
p313_263|it's up to ann.
p313_264|we are playing them at their own game.
p313_265|by this point the couple were approaching fast.
p313_266|i had trouble with the producers.
p313_267|so it took me back to boarding school.
p313_268|they just thought it was extremely good acting.
p313_269|the conference is the first test.
p313_270|that's what we're trying to achieve.
p313_271|i expect a rapid response.
p313_272|there was still more disquiet in israel.
p313_273|there is no more money.
p313_274|my mother is a widow.
p313_275|the rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p313_276|there have been different reports from different people.
p313_277|it's an absolute disgrace.
p313_278|something was plainly wrong.
p313_279|why should he go anywhere?
p313_280|one thing is sure.
p313_281|it was a foolhardy decision.
p313_282|i'm confident we can do that.
p313_283|funding needs to be long term.
p313_284|it's funny how it comes and goes.
p313_285|i would never even consider it.
p313_286|we're talking about the outskirts of london.
p313_287|the end result is precisely the same.
p313_288|we have it on video.
p313_289|i'm not a threat to coaches.
p313_290|painful but only because it's true.
p313_291|it's never over until it's over.
p313_292|colonel about this committee that is coming.
p313_293|this year it was a little different.
p313_294|that though is to miss the point.
p313_295|we gave them the goal.
p313_296|is being naturally funny enough?
p313_297|what's the point of staying sober?
p313_298|we did discuss the lockerbie issue.
p313_299|the incident is being taken seriously.
p313_300|so what's the shape and what's the detail?
p313_301|they were going through the motions but that's about all.
p313_302|i can feel the sound inside.
p313_303|i'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p313_304|i'm not a fan of books.
p313_305|so now we know the secret.
p313_306|it may well have been.
p313_307|i never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p313_308|it was a simple question.
p313_309|i find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p313_310|and we've beaten them before.
p313_311|could you put it in writing?
p313_312|i'm not a paedophile.
p313_313|some of their movement was excellent.
p313_314|but they had to be paid for.
p313_315|the odds are that it will.
p313_316|but then they scored their fourth.
p313_317|they deserve a lot of credit.
p313_318|that's the position that the mod has adopted.
p313_319|why is that?
p313_320|then came the crunch.
p313_321|but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p313_322|but will they fall in love?
p313_323|as if they ever stopped.
p313_324|the referee had a shocking game.
p313_325|players are fighting to stay in the team.
p313_326|for a few years we had good fun.
p313_327|medical staff are with them at the moment.
p313_328|it went on to become an annual event.
p313_329|this is the logic of punishment assaults.
p313_330|we are now in an election period.
p313_331|everyone's too upset to comment.
p313_332|three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p313_333|but when we do it is great.
p313_334|she has nothing to say to journalists.
p313_335|i didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p313_336|he pleaded for caution.
p313_339|i can't believe the buzz.
p313_340|i'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p313_341|the picture is the same across scotland.
p313_342|when it comes down to it this is a job.
p313_343|it's no less intriguing however.
p313_344|it's a question of perception.
p313_345|staff have been informed.
p313_346|my heart is not so sure.
p313_347|this morning was very quiet.
p313_348|on reflection it was really quite exciting.
p313_349|it's been handled entirely properly.
p313_350|i shall be voting yes to support him.
p313_351|that might help a bit.
p313_352|two others were also seriously injured.
p313_353|he was made redundant in february of last year.
p313_354|overall it was a promising day for the scots.
p313_355|next league matches motherwell dundee united.
p313_356|you've obviously got an answer to it.
p313_357|it seems very odd.
p313_358|closure is not one of them.
p313_359|the hotel was huge.
p313_360|a handful of those restrictions are in scotland.
p313_361|well you can have a tree.
p313_362|it was the same at twickenham.
p313_363|this is an internal matter.
p313_364|i'm amazed at what he's done.
p313_365|they took a risk.
p313_366|the idea was presented to me.
p313_367|the hearing in edinburgh continues.
p313_368|he suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p313_369|his appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p313_370|the hearing was fair.
p313_371|i see it as my job.
p313_372|this was not a summit about the euro.
p313_373|frank warren is a great man.
p313_374|i'm a little bit tired.
p313_375|that was never their agenda.
p313_376|she died at her home.
p313_377|she's currently in foster care.
p313_378|that's the only thing that matters.
p313_379|i enjoy the creative process.
p313_380|they were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p313_381|it is however an unlikely outcome.
p313_382|as it was a double it was pretty expensive.
p313_383|it's always the same isn't it?
p313_384|we have been preparing all year.
p313_385|we could learn a lot from them.
p313_386|i can't wait for the outdoors.
p313_387|sure we have problems.
p313_388|i was released after six days.
p313_389|that time is not far away.
p313_390|i may think about performing it.
p313_391|there are a number of possible outcomes.
p313_392|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p313_393|this is the last thing we ever expected.
p313_394|you can't go back and change things.
p313_395|it's time to fight a decisive battle.
p313_396|of course it is a tough assignment.
p313_397|instead it's back to the drawing board.
p313_398|he says it often enough.
p313_399|actually he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p313_400|his primary residence is scotland.
p313_401|i found that much more challenging.
p313_402|this fight is not going to go away.
p313_403|it would have been very easily done.
p313_404|i will never manage another scottish club.
p313_405|the open champion is back.
p313_406|it's going to be a new challenge.
p313_407|as indeed they would be.
p313_408|i want to keep him.
p313_409|he deserves a top team.
p313_410|i knew people on that committee.
p313_411|the next eight weeks are critical to us.
p313_412|yes it gave me a lot of confidence.
p313_413|her grand daughter was uninjured.
p313_414|we never agreed to it.
p313_415|but that night they killed her housekeeper.
p313_416|but it's not the end of scottish football.
p313_417|sightings were replaced by rumours.
p313_418|would they work together again?
p313_419|i didn't play all that well.
p313_420|who can tell?
p313_421|it appears to have been closed down.
p313_422|now that is a good deal.
p313_423|the whole nation will be delighted.
p314_001|please call stella.
p314_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p314_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p314_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p314_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p314_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p314_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p314_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p314_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p314_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p314_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p314_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p314_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p314_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p314_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p314_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p314_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p314_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p314_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p314_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p314_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p314_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p314_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p314_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p314_025|the scots are however in good company.
p314_026|he was born in london of scottish parents.
p314_027|her condition last night was described as critical.
p314_028|princess margaret is being buried on that day.
p314_029|four other charges were dropped.
p314_030|i believe in the church.
p314_031|we are just being flooded.
p314_032|it was not the greatest performance but it was effective.
p314_033|they tend to be easily influenced by others.
p314_034|it's about bringing people in breaking down barriers.
p314_035|well what do you know?
p314_036|but she was very human.
p314_037|there are some serious ethical issues involved.
p314_038|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p314_039|his concern is only for the future.
p314_040|we have reacted well to each other.
p314_041|pupils and staff were sent home early.
p314_042|it is all about people being assaulted abused.
p314_043|i'm delighted with how he has come through.
p314_044|in fact he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
p314_045|he will emerge as a world leader.
p314_046|that view has not altered.
p314_047|i only half believe it.
p314_048|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p314_049|all the oil companies are talking together.
p314_050|we have no choice but to shut down.
p314_051|i'm feeling pretty good.
p314_052|the prognosis is excellent.
p314_053|rangers deserved to beat us.
p314_054|that though is the measure of the man.
p314_055|it was developed in the gulf war.
p314_056|sub not used mackay.
p314_057|it is not normal practice.
p314_058|but he just carried on anyway.
p314_059|the spirit in the squad is certainly good.
p314_060|what happens next?
p314_061|i would not want to be young again.
p314_062|meanwhile the search continues for ferguson's replacement.
p314_063|i'm astonished the men were not injured.
p314_064|there are schoolboys in uniform.
p314_065|except this time it seems he really really means it.
p314_066|they were later discharged from hospital.
p314_067|let's see that increase over the years.
p314_068|i've learned a lot and tomorrow is another day.
p314_069|they knew they shouldn't have been there.
p314_070|these findings would be made public.
p314_071|it's the most beautiful place on earth.
p314_072|i think overall they were the best team in the tournament.
p314_073|you can't go on forever.
p314_074|all the lads are totally focused on that.
p314_075|so far this season this approach is working.
p314_076|i have got a knife.
p314_077|if you don't enforce it you bring it into disrepute.
p314_078|what did we learn?
p314_079|i go home only once.
p314_080|i'm not going to answer that right now.
p314_081|it had a gigantic effect.
p314_082|on that basis he would set it aside.
p314_083|i like many others will consider where we go from here.
p314_084|bin laden was not mentioned.
p314_085|does it work is it safe and is it right?
p314_086|the team this year is going places.
p314_087|it opens the door to the champions league.
p314_088|we should do everything at a stroke.
p314_089|he had a moustache.
p314_090|he has changed my life for ever.
p314_091|it plans to return to this field.
p314_092|he said because people had invited him.
p314_093|action must be taken urgently.
p314_094|they are completely different from each other.
p314_095|the money is not really our concern.
p314_096|hopefully it will pay off for me.
p314_097|correction knowing him he might.
p314_098|i came up through the ranks.
p314_099|why does she suddenly win everything now?
p314_100|his team management was protective.
p314_101|he was the deputy editor at the paper.
p314_102|the proposal was rejected.
p314_103|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p314_104|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p314_105|that would be even more disastrous.
p314_106|these guys will not lie down.
p314_107|you can expect a hell of a fuss.
p314_108|harrowing is easy after all.
p314_109|that is nearly four people every day.
p314_110|there are nine people here now.
p314_111|is my wife a racist?
p314_112|it is a pity but you can't have everything.
p314_113|this would not be my first choice.
p314_114|his wife margaret was not in court.
p314_115|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p314_116|which perhaps is just as well.
p314_117|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p314_118|he would just say it was terrible.
p314_119|they have got their position we have got our position.
p314_120|that's not fair to the supporters.
p314_121|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p314_122|but the killer remains at large.
p314_123|it is a great shame.
p314_124|there are a lot of examples.
p314_125|but it will backfire.
p314_126|but then he changed his mind.
p314_127|i really hope he thinks that through.
p314_128|police were also perplexed.
p314_129|for sure you won't know unless you ask him.
p314_130|it's very tragic and traumatic.
p314_131|for me it's a tension you can feel.
p314_132|that's a huge amount.
p314_133|the final stage is paranoia.
p314_134|i'm not holding the club to ransom.
p314_135|her advice for glasgow is just be visionary.
p314_136|folk music is in her blood.
p314_137|pig farmers are completely despondent.
p314_138|they are currently managed by ian wilson.
p314_139|we would love for him to stay but he's going home.
p314_140|i would love it.
p314_141|this is the high point of my career.
p314_142|that's the sort of game you want.
p314_143|my duty is to win.
p314_144|scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p314_145|we are trying to clarify the issues.
p314_146|now we look forward to it.
p314_147|there is no such thing.
p314_148|we've had an enjoyable adventure.
p314_149|he was telling me to keep quiet.
p314_150|it was a moment of madness.
p314_151|don't even bother applying.
p314_152|but perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p314_153|we like being the underdogs.
p314_154|we haven't seen from the bank of scotland.
p314_155|but we are not immune to the problem.
p314_156|racism has no place in any sport.
p314_157|it's all too short term.
p314_158|it is believed she had serious head injuries.
p314_159|we must move on.
p314_160|drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p314_161|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p314_162|the pilot was making a visual approach.
p314_163|i'd say we should give it a week.
p314_164|the elections should have no role in this.
p314_165|i should not be able to stand.
p314_166|many other scottish locations also feature.
p314_167|little voice is on general release.
p314_168|frankly it was worth the booking.
p314_169|that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p314_170|they've got to get better.
p314_171|he realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p314_172|this is good news for the western isles.
p314_173|we've got the top three.
p314_174|i was never alone with her right?
p314_175|there is no substitute.
p314_176|that nation is south africa.
p314_177|this will secure the future of our industry.
p314_178|it's just a normal life.
p314_179|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p314_180|i cannot speak on behalf of the ira.
p314_181|wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p314_182|that's when you hope to take advantage.
p314_183|he is the example for all of us.
p314_184|there is no way to do this.
p314_185|it was an empowering journey.
p314_186|clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
p314_187|i certainly do not agree with that.
p314_188|it was a disaster of a race.
p314_189|it's not unlike the millennium bug.
p314_190|no it's never been mentioned.
p314_191|they had been together for about three years.
p314_192|o neill has delivered.
p314_193|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p314_194|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p314_195|our customers come first.
p314_196|we will reform the welfare state.
p314_197|it may be his last for a while too.
p314_198|his director of football is leaving.
p314_199|mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
p314_200|the painting was started but finishing it was quite another matter.
p314_201|he is married with one daughter and lives in kent.
p314_202|we don't want to be too intrusive.
p314_203|we just want to get stuck in now.
p314_204|drugs are getting through.
p314_205|do you come from moscow?
p314_206|he or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p314_207|that night was a terrible muddle.
p314_208|we are aware of the tribunal case.
p314_209|you saw the football.
p314_210|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p314_211|he added it is all about the search for power.
p314_212|but he was a full working member of our staff.
p314_213|i am a little bit tired.
p314_214|broke the birdie record.
p314_215|we have an attorney on the ground.
p314_216|i looked forward to it.
p314_217|that was a disgraceful performance.
p314_218|i'd come back from london.
p314_219|that it is a brand name.
p314_220|she was an only child.
p314_221|the text is reduced to bubbles.
p314_222|they should come forward.
p314_223|we don't say there was a massacre.
p314_224|john lennon is a very large industry.
p314_225|the island will never recover.
p314_226|that is not an easy thing.
p314_227|asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p314_228|those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p314_229|three weeks later he resigned.
p314_230|it is a court case.
p314_231|she was a delightful person.
p314_232|the next one comes up.
p314_233|this fact is supported by audience research.
p314_234|of further privacy he had no need.
p314_235|come to that is any of this really happening?
p314_236|both sides have to step back.
p314_237|this is wonderful news.
p314_238|is he going to look after them?
p314_239|but if they were there they were keeping a low profile.
p314_240|they scored a goal but we have to keep playing.
p314_241|obviously we would want to look at this.
p314_242|we are ready for the long haul.
p314_243|i was just getting over the time difference.
p314_244|i don't have any answer for them.
p314_245|i look for dancers who are also actors.
p314_246|however civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p314_247|the death toll included five children.
p314_248|emi is a prime example.
p314_249|i'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p314_250|and what is she escaping from?
p314_251|you cannot allow it to go on.
p314_252|a scottish film studio is also being considered.
p314_253|not that agassi was a believer.
p314_254|a friendship that will endure.
p314_255|tourism is a vital industry for scotland.
p314_256|it needs to be sorted out by easter.
p314_257|that will not change.
p314_258|he has already received the freedom of aberdeen.
p314_259|i thought that all musicians were the same.
p314_260|i am deeply sorry they did.
p314_261|nowadays it is workers united.
p314_262|asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p314_263|who would have thought it?
p314_264|he is young but not too young.
p314_265|i played well on saturday and again today.
p314_266|lara is very very much a girl.
p314_267|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p314_268|i took a minibus into town.
p314_269|they've been at it for five hours.
p314_270|i'm not talking about his career.
p314_271|i watched a game.
p314_272|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p314_273|blair is very positive at european councils.
p314_274|certainly in terms of league position we must be favourites.
p314_275|he has lost confidence and weight.
p314_276|intensive care has been very busy.
p314_277|there was no let up for the minnows.
p314_278|birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p314_279|it could be a danger.
p314_280|this is my home town.
p314_281|his english counterpart agreed.
p314_282|we will build upon the basic state pension.
p314_283|nothing can bring back their son.
p314_284|it was frightening intense and primal theatre.
p314_285|it's part of the game isn't it?
p314_286|some may end up in hospital.
p314_287|the first eviction takes place on sunday.
p314_288|the alliance said it may not wait.
p314_289|i'm not putting myself down.
p314_290|that is highly unfair.
p314_291|there is great demand for human cloning.
p314_292|i'm very tired but it was worth it.
p314_293|i am just trying to do my job.
p314_294|i don't think we could have expected better.
p314_295|you take a risk.
p314_296|what are you going to do exactly?
p314_297|glasgow deserved their win but we made them look good.
p314_298|mr mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p314_299|i just want to change my life.
p314_300|a statement is expected in april.
p314_301|check that he is dead.
p314_302|celtic connections is here again and the great debate.
p314_303|he is also a great finisher.
p314_304|this club have been fair to me.
p314_305|he knew it would cost him millions.
p314_306|this is too much like scotland.
p314_307|he's been here on numerous occasions.
p314_308|a counter reaction was.
p314_309|he said he was sorry.
p314_310|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p314_311|clearly she says we would never resort to such devices.
p314_312|that only came out during a radio interview.
p314_313|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p314_314|we are waiting for them to calm down.
p314_315|we are now setting about finding them.
p314_316|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p314_317|neither was involved in violence.
p314_318|it won't happen overnight but things will get better.
p314_319|lucky for us he enjoyed the experience.
p314_320|i am not among its admirers.
p314_321|hitches can be expected.
p314_322|he wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p314_323|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p314_324|i'll tell you honestly.
p314_325|dialogue is the key.
p314_326|he will address the nation this evening.
p314_327|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p314_328|i couldn't really work outside edinburgh.
p314_329|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p314_330|but he is revelling in the big stage.
p314_331|you have to think not.
p314_332|no no it's not what you think.
p314_333|this is a national crisis.
p314_334|scotland were beaten again.
p314_335|again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p314_336|moving from manchester to london was upheaval enough.
p314_337|the whole thing would be perfect.
p314_338|what is the working families tax credit?
p314_339|there is no magical figure but there are criteria.
p314_340|however we had no failures on our side.
p314_341|she had been sexually assaulted.
p314_342|his job was not advertised.
p314_343|the event has now gone to helsinki.
p314_344|it is a thing of beauty to watch.
p314_345|with us we just want them to respond.
p314_346|and the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p314_347|they are the heroes.
p314_348|for me it was a shattering experience.
p314_349|scottish life can be like this too.
p314_350|this seems like a very good idea.
p314_351|it was not confirmed by scotland yard.
p314_352|their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p314_353|it took more than two years.
p314_354|there is access for disabled people.
p314_355|the home was now under new management.
p314_356|we don't want to push him.
p314_357|i like what has happened
p314_358|it is like a theatre of the absurd.
p314_359|one was a lawyer.
p314_360|there is no openness.
p314_361|we are still going ahead with our plans.
p314_362|it's being very carefully looked at.
p314_363|it was a job he loved.
p314_364|now it has become a big picture.
p314_365|it may encourage more people to prospect.
p314_366|but let's not get carried away.
p314_367|filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p314_368|this is the last thing we ever expected.
p314_369|it looks like paradise.
p314_370|this means a great deal to the families.
p314_371|alcohol and nicotine are now no go areas.
p314_372|we were short of athletes.
p314_373|they want to avoid a flashpoint.
p314_374|the european is a piece of vanity publishing.
p314_375|we want to keep the pound.
p314_376|the wealth of talent in australia is awesome.
p314_377|only local people are helping.
p314_378|they are so easy for youngsters to open.
p314_379|there were three boys and two girls.
p314_380|even though the show is seriously exacting physically demanding.
p314_381|he had no answer.
p314_382|there is a job to be done.
p314_383|scotland is too small a country for that.
p314_384|i am not obsessed with sex.
p314_385|muslim leaders in italy have denied the charge.
p314_386|i can't believe what has happened.
p314_387|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p314_388|you do that because you want to win.
p314_389|at this level you have all to perform well.
p314_390|it was early morning.
p314_391|partition is not an option.
p314_392|we've been treated with complete contempt.
p314_393|there must be boundaries.
p314_394|i cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p314_395|the home team had an amazing start.
p314_396|we can make changes.
p314_397|it is a comforting fantasy but it remains a fantasy.
p314_398|the conclusion is enthralling.
p314_399|instead it is back to the drawing board.
p314_400|this is usually done by the space shuttle.
p314_401|the best option is to destroy the plants.
p314_402|anyway even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p314_403|friends of the family have given their support.
p314_404|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p314_405|you name it they have it.
p314_406|we are obviously disturbed by this case.
p314_407|the review has been conducted fairly.
p314_408|there is no smoking gun.
p314_409|we could play someone else but he is ready to play.
p314_410|he feels he has cost us the game but he didn't.
p314_411|he is very popular in the squad in england and abroad.
p314_412|it is a natural reaction.
p314_413|whether this return was too soon.
p314_414|i don't believe that money is the answer.
p314_415|jackson may well be right.
p314_416|i am in a very difficult position.
p314_417|they will run in tandem with new work.
p314_418|as for owen class is permanent.
p314_419|the pain was almost too much to bear.
p314_420|my thoughts are with their families.
p314_421|he is not very big either.
p314_422|hopefully we can learn from our mistakes.
p314_423|how come it is so often unnoticed?
p316_001|please call stella.
p316_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p316_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p316_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p316_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p316_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p316_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p316_008|these take the shape of a long round arc with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p316_009|there is according to a legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p316_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p316_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p316_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p316_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p316_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p316_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p316_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p316_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p316_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p316_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p316_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p316_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
p316_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p316_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p316_025|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p316_026|meetings will also remain private.
p316_027|have we tried everything?
p316_028|it's not going to work out that way.
p316_029|we have worked hard.
p316_030|after that it's a step into the unknown.
p316_031|naturally she said yes.
p316_032|this is not a war on terror.
p316_033|it is not for any other purpose.
p316_034|there will always be problems on the way.
p316_035|why you did it will never be known.
p316_036|he was in his element.
p316_037|she is believed to be in south africa.
p316_038|what a week he has had.
p316_039|we just want this season to end.
p316_040|he is looking for a sporting challenge.
p316_041|there is a new confidence about the club.
p316_042|i accept that but is very upsetting.
p316_043|we accept the challenge.
p316_044|the question is will it be enough?
p316_045|after that it is up to the boss.
p316_046|they were taken to prove a point.
p316_047|it doesn't have to be in inverness.
p316_048|and they removed a borderer.
p316_049|so why does he do it?
p316_050|i would love to have him home.
p316_051|it is very unfair and something should be done.
p316_052|he had no enemies.
p316_053|that is not the case this time.
p316_054|we are going to new broomfield to win.
p316_055|but the law is very clear on this.
p316_056|they treated me with respect and courtesy.
p316_057|there was only silence.
p316_058|however he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p316_059|it doesn't look as pretty.
p316_060|however our players will fight for that.
p316_061|everyone was very saddened.
p316_062|he declined to give further details.
p316_063|he said it was for sale.
p316_064|this is a dream come true.
p316_065|the problem is not confined to the uk.
p316_066|i wouldn't give them a grade.
p316_067|what on earth is wrong with you?
p316_068|this is far too high.
p316_069|we are still going ahead with our plans.
p316_070|is tony blair on drugs?
p316_071|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p316_072|it has certainly paid off for him.
p316_073|he was also a great man.
p316_074|we have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316_075|it is clear that change is required.
p316_076|thirty schools were closed in the western isles.
p316_077|this is a big step up.
p316_078|robin williams is subdued.
p316_079|the judge was very nice.
p316_080|they control the prices paid to farmers.
p316_081|the company yesterday refused to comment.
p316_082|most of them have already gone home.
p316_083|worse still he might be singing lady in red.
p316_084|weaknesses there are however.
p316_085|it is after all a very funny play.
p316_086|can you imagine a world without design?
p316_087|he was caught and fired.
p316_088|i feel confident about the outcome.
p316_089|the driver escaped injury.
p316_090|mini rugby is a great thing.
p316_091|there was no bad behaviour.
p316_092|today she has been released.
p316_093|it's a much bigger problem.
p316_094|there are no problems between us at all.
p316_095|hopefully he will be back in contention next week.
p316_096|i've had it for the exams.
p316_097|i hope it comes out all right.
p316_098|i will just have to be patient.
p316_099|it's a sensible management decision.
p316_100|i kept it very simple.
p316_101|the rest was badminton.
p316_102|it will take several days.
p316_103|we had to push to get a goal.
p316_104|that got me out.
p316_105|i would just like someone to confess.
p316_106|we are making progress on waiting lists.
p316_107|it will have to ratify the deal.
p316_108|i did not have faith in the procedures.
p316_109|i was not a joiner.
p316_110|it has to find out what went wrong.
p316_111|until you hit the big games.
p316_112|it has until saturday.
p316_113|i've tried to get on with my life.
p316_114|she has the biggest part.
p316_115|we will win this tie.
p316_116|this is totally untrue.
p316_117|or someone wants to say something different.
p316_118|i think they have to change that.
p316_119|this series is for real.
p316_120|it's great news isn't it.
p316_121|it's very ingenious.
p316_122|that would depend on the parole board.
p316_123|it is all up to the members.
p316_124|the two sets are different.
p316_125|and now the pressure is off.
p316_126|you can see the appeal of running away.
p316_127|their opening was disastrous.
p316_128|the time is up for iraq to comply.
p316_129|there can be no compromise on that demand.
p316_130|the following are the principal provisions.
p316_131|too much has already been said.
p316_132|now however things are different.
p316_133|it was not a beautiful game was it?
p316_134|she is not the world champion.
p316_135|it would be difficult to argue with that.
p316_136|while they went on a holiday we got the contract.
p316_137|he is a bully.
p316_138|the case was taken on by his brother.
p316_139|i've won the british.
p316_140|and so the cycle continues.
p316_141|i don't have many friends.
p316_142|however it was a different story in the final.
p316_143|they exist in name alone.
p316_144|i am not retiring.
p316_145|all will be revealed in due course.
p316_146|in the current outbreak the reverse is true.
p316_147|and frankly it's been a while.
p316_148|feel for five seconds.
p316_149|i hope it is a good omen.
p316_150|because if it matters to them it matters to me.
p316_151|they will appear again next week.
p316_152|failure is not an option.
p316_153|we were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p316_154|you look at that.
p316_155|things begin to spring to life.
p316_156|or was it some kind of a ham?
p316_157|i understood that concern.
p316_158|the things writers and directors say
p316_159|i am prepared to step down.
p316_160|it was like a dream to be here.
p316_161|the four characters could be one somebody suggested.
p316_162|either way it doesn't bother me.
p316_163|it would help to heal the wounds.
p316_164|we did not deserve to go through.
p316_165|it's got to be in the head.
p316_166|it certainly sounded it at times.
p316_167|it will be too hot.
p316_168|that happens in boxing.
p316_169|consumers will also benefit.
p316_170|none of the opinions is good.
p316_171|we were hopeful that it would be successful.
p316_172|they must not succeed.
p316_173|he declined to provide a breakdown.
p316_174|but the foundations have been laid.
p316_175|i have never seen him like that.
p316_176|and you need to be so resourceful.
p316_177|suddenly the fir park side were in disarerry.
p316_178|she hopes to study in britain one day.
p316_179|everything in the world was focused on london.
p316_180|we played better after the break.
p316_181|but this relative success has not been easy.
p316_182|it was the same with the dickens.
p316_183|of course it is still possible.
p316_184|actually it's an amazing orchestra.
p316_185|that in a way is the point.
p316_186|what is so unusual about this case?
p316_187|it is not about the money it is about everything.
p316_188|that would end it for us.
p316_189|police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
p316_190|sure he is the best player in the world.
p316_191|i just love lessons.
p316_192|retirement is on his mind.
p316_193|it's to do with this place.
p316_194|the home side didn't stand a chance.
p316_195|we shall not be moved.
p316_196|the prime minister was informed on thursday.
p316_197|it is not just the agencies.
p316_198|there must be boundaries.
p316_199|however he was later released without charge.
p316_200|arsenal refused to be evicted.
p316_201|i watch the other visitors.
p316_202|nobody is pushing out to the right.
p316_204|he confirmed his fitness.
p316_205|the gap is narrowing.
p316_206|all of us in scotland should be viligant.
p316_207|both men were uninjured.
p316_208|my husband was fighting for his life.
p316_209|it is not a financial issue.
p316_210|we are in this for the long haul.
p316_211|we have a budget in march.
p316_212|there was no respite.
p316_213|i got very very tired.
p316_214|i am really sorry that he is going.
p316_215|they will do their own thing.
p316_216|it is too much for me.
p316_217|but is this enough to provoke a killing?
p316_218|i didn't just walk in and get it.
p316_219|we've made a couple of albums.
p316_220|we need a much wider debate.
p316_221|my attitude is exactly the same as before.
p316_222|look at a computer.
p316_223|they went back to the seventeenth.
p316_224|first the programme was unbalanced.
p316_225|so what could be better than becoming a captain?
p316_226|however it proved to be the turning point.
p316_227|however everyone should do it once in their life.
p316_228|in hindsight it was the wrong decision.
p316_229|i waited and waited.
p316_230|we all knew it could not be true.
p316_231|its future is uncertain.
p316_232|i'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p316_233|it doesn't look good for her.
p316_234|she said he did not look too happy.
p316_235|we are aware of the problem.
p316_236|where will the elderly go then?
p316_237|then it was changed without notice.
p316_238|he had a great game.
p316_239|the following year they asked him again.
p316_240|it is the men who create the demand.
p316_241|i'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
p316_242|every case is completely different.
p316_243|it's a scandal a disgrace.
p316_244|planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p316_245|however he said the money had not been wasted.
p316_246|it will be fine.
p316_247|he should emerge as the winner.
p316_248|they are you the fans.
p316_249|we're just waiting for her reaction.
p316_250|at the end of the day two men have been shot.
p316_251|what a difference a game can make.
p316_252|they will not be able to come back in my opinion.
p316_253|why do it?
p316_254|it opened last month.
p316_255|this will be our new beginning.
p316_256|if they don't they might well decide not to play.
p316_257|i have totally had enough.
p316_258|hopefully today will be the turning point.
p316_259|we shall be ready for rangers.
p316_260|it was bound to happen and it has happened.
p316_261|there were no reported casualties on the ground.
p316_262|what are you waiting for?
p316_263|in the meantime everyone is taking everyone to court.
p316_264|this is still happening in the us.
p316_265|another issue will be policing.
p316_266|today was first class.
p316_267|this is the biggest surprise of my life.
p316_268|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p316_269|this is a good move for me.
p316_270|feel the heat?
p316_271|she was so full of life.
p316_272|i should have given him one in return.
p316_273|i began to pray.
p316_274|the princess has strong links with scotland.
p316_275|i am very confident about tomorrow night.
p316_276|i just wanted to fly.
p316_277|and he has a tale to tell.
p316_278|footballers have also been targeted.
p316_279|the deadline is real and absolute.
p316_280|so how did this happen?
p316_281|it's all a part of letting it go.
p316_282|i just hope it's not tonight against us.
p316_283|there are no quick fixes.
p316_284|the change was not instant.
p316_285|we've got the bronze.
p316_286|they use them for everything.
p316_287|who is to benefit from this change?
p316_288|we are not defeated.
p316_289|he knows what he's got to do.
p316_290|clearly the stakes are high.
p316_291|we have been going for three years.
p316_292|we deserved the three points.
p316_293|it is planned for london in the spring.
p316_294|war and force are not the only solutions.
p316_295|they would have to go to the royal.
p316_296|it didn't matter who was in their way.
p316_297|which brings us to the point.
p316_298|i think it's difficult for bonnie.
p316_299|i am quite excited about it.
p316_300|everyone agrees with that.
p316_301|she had denied the charge.
p316_302|if we live forever can we really be said to live?
p316_303|sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
p316_304|i didn't feel good.
p316_305|it is believed that he had been stabbed.
p316_306|it is an expensive part of their equipment.
p316_307|let's get to know him.
p316_308|we have got to attack.
p316_309|well they were the unlucky ones.
p316_310|time has run out for saddam hussein.
p316_311|it divided audiences at cannes.
p316_312|it's a lovely lovely film.
p316_313|how would it work?
p316_314|we told them in july.
p316_315|the film was great.
p316_316|venus rejects the very suggestion.
p316_317|it's a real challenge.
p316_318|the police believe that the man was not injured.
p316_319|everyone in britain is proud of this team.
p316_320|there was too much at stake.
p316_321|i read about it in the newspapers.
p316_322|what did they think of her voice?
p316_323|is that not uncanny?
p316_324|it has to reinvent itself.
p316_325|it is a good result for great britain.
p316_326|he was happy with his form.
p316_327|his art was not just about emotions.
p316_328|nato was not a love affair.
p316_329|it's a production company.
p316_330|but we will not be scared.
p316_331|but that is not an issue for now.
p316_332|it will not work in our favour.
p316_333|it is the wealthiest in europe.
p316_334|he is on the wrong side.
p316_335|that was a disgraceful performance.
p316_336|there will be no receivers.
p316_337|my son was too young to die.
p316_338|the air campaign is not over yet.
p316_339|it's a national sport.
p316_340|but this isn't a play about the troubles.
p316_341|the picture in glasgow was improving he added.
p316_342|only new zealand has seen a similar increase.
p316_343|i was shocked and outraged.
p316_344|not many people like to do that.
p316_345|it was extremely cold.
p316_346|italy would be lukewarm.
p316_347|people are using it in their daily lives.
p316_348|chelsea was a great club.
p316_349|we have to open up.
p316_350|she is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p316_351|there is a review outgoing at the moment.
p316_352|the pensioners did not want to know.
p316_353|it was just awful.
p316_354|we are doing okay in the league.
p316_355|today the kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
p316_356|it is time for concerted national action.
p316_357|do you know who we are?
p316_358|souter will be back.
p316_359|i'd like to report a murder.
p316_360|i'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p316_361|it certainly gives you hope.
p316_362|if he does not leave he will be shot.
p316_363|two people have died.
p316_364|fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p316_365|i am delighted to have her back home.
p316_366|many of them were his friends and colleagues.
p316_367|it is based on his movement records.
p316_368|it wasn't an easy decision.
p316_369|it left me with sadness.
p316_370|there is a changing of the guard.
p316_371|the boys are very confident.
p316_372|it was our time maybe.
p316_373|i know we can play a lot better.
p316_374|we said it will happen one night.
p316_375|it is a flexible concept.
p316_376|this election is far from over.
p316_377|so the government will be damaged.
p316_378|ali was shot at but refused to back down.
p316_379|however we let them back into the game.
p316_380|i have great confidence in annabelle.
p316_381|is that such a bad thing?
p316_382|you do need a check and a balance.
p316_383|thousands of people were missing.
p316_384|maloney is an engaging talent.
p316_385|it's time to move on.
p316_386|i couldn't get out of bed.
p316_387|mr campbell received a phone call.
p316_388|i'm delighted and the players were brilliant.
p316_389|i can't describe it.
p316_390|it changed my life.
p316_391|but what will we put on it?
p316_392|it will benefit a lot of people.
p316_393|a new school will be built.
p316_394|there may be hope this year however.
p316_395|that is not too bad.
p316_396|they are taking a stand against this.
p316_397|they are not left wing.
p316_398|i was the sheep.
p316_399|i think we believed the tie was won.
p316_400|well there you go.
p316_401|how do you find the youngsters?
p316_402|it was a great team effort.
p316_403|in my experience he does not do that.
p316_404|mr forrester reacted angrily.
p316_405|i am glad that justice has been done.
p316_406|its first awards will just do that.
p316_407|the whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p316_408|that is my preference.
p316_409|taxation should be simplified.
p316_410|we should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p316_411|it is not that sort of inquiry.
p316_412|i have signed a contract.
p316_413|i have never been overly ambitious.
p316_414|we were beaten by the better team.
p316_415|i hope you don't regret it.
p316_416|he was all blackened.
p316_417|this is your country.
p316_418|this is the greatest moment of our lives.
p316_419|audiences there were shocked.
p316_420|they responded in the most positive way.
p316_421|the british government said she was coming home.
p316_422|we won very easily.
p316_423|that is a matter for mr graham.
p317_001|please call stella.
p317_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p317_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p317_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p317_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p317_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p317_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p317_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p317_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p317_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p317_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p317_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p317_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p317_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p317_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p317_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p317_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p317_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p317_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p317_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p317_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p317_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p317_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p317_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p317_025|they have the cash to do that.
p317_026|there was a fine line to tread.
p317_027|yet it is all for two good causes.
p317_028|it is so elusive and light.
p317_029|i am not a fan of stoppages.
p317_030|the council has been open and transparent.
p317_031|is the war over?
p317_032|the country is in a state of chaos.
p317_033|but don't expect an easy ride.
p317_034|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p317_035|some us embassy staff have left the country.
p317_036|it was a policy they were against.
p317_037|her mother said she fell off a swing.
p317_038|we see little sign of improvement.
p317_039|the study carried out by the consumer magazine which?
p317_040|the gaffer was great.
p317_041|overall however these were also down.
p317_042|ten years on that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p317_043|had she enjoyed the experience?
p317_044|i feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p317_045|she had travelled to spain to give evidence.
p317_046|i would think they are just behind them.
p317_047|we then went to see the headmaster.
p317_048|as far as we are concerned he is innocent anyway.
p317_049|there is no mandate for a regime change.
p317_050|he did the right thing by ignoring me.
p317_051|these men are a part of india.
p317_052|are we going to stay up?
p317_053|sub not used mcculloch.
p317_054|i am going home to see my children.
p317_055|new potential dangers were emerging.
p317_056|that tells you something about them.
p317_057|the father was treated like a criminal and why?
p317_058|i am a drug addict.
p317_059|i've had to take time off work today.
p317_060|the problem is the book.
p317_061|there was no basis for their arrest.
p317_062|this wasn't just a big crowd.
p317_063|i wondered about changing back to rugby.
p317_064|they say he wants to go to england.
p317_065|they are the partner of choice for anyone.
p317_066|donald dewar was passionate about his politics.
p317_067|wagner was never like this.
p317_068|it is an attitude of mind.
p317_069|how do you resurrect a dying town?
p317_070|and what does it cost and who is paying?
p317_071|i've come here for the jersey.
p317_072|this is not an optional extra.
p317_073|this is not the most crucial issue.
p317_074|we don't know much but we are still awaiting news.
p317_075|it's that sort of night.
p317_076|morale is very high despite the growing risks.
p317_077|will we ever play together again?
p317_078|it's been a terrible ordeal for margaret.
p317_079|i played well but missed a few chances.
p317_080|that must be left to the parole board.
p317_081|i'm so proud of my team.
p317_082|they have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p317_083|that would open the gates of hell.
p317_084|this has not and has been neglected.
p317_085|mcnaughton was not so sure.
p317_086|what did you learn in school today?
p317_087|if you're a national company you must provide it all.
p317_088|we will see how he is after treatment.
p317_089|this is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
p317_090|there is no signature on this document.
p317_091|we could not compete with rangers.
p317_092|in the event it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p317_093|but they must serve their sentence in scotland.
p317_094|he was critically ill in hospital last night.
p317_095|however it is much bigger than that.
p317_096|one season they might do well.
p317_097|our approach will be different.
p317_098|too much has already been said.
p317_099|he asked me in a tolerance zone.
p317_100|but don't worry just yet.
p317_101|this championship is different from the other majors.
p317_102|for now though my future is with rangers.
p317_103|i drove the ball well.
p317_104|if so how does it intend to achieve this result?
p317_105|his handling raises a wider issue.
p317_106|we have got the school holidays on.
p317_107|this is not a recipe for conflict.
p317_108|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p317_109|we understand the changes in the world.
p317_110|it is a potential factor.
p317_111|this is the big one.
p317_112|that just wasn't good enough.
p317_113|the company has other problems with the shells.
p317_114|the working families tax credit is far better.
p317_115|he had done his homework properly.
p317_116|then as we know too well anything can happen.
p317_117|we must get the three points.
p317_118|players were held in equally low regard.
p317_119|i was in the train station overnight.
p317_120|it's to do with context.
p317_121|now we need to keep our heads up.
p317_122|our home is your home.
p317_123|it is essential that we win the game.
p317_124|there was no confusion over the second.
p317_125|alan milburn the health secretary refused to comment.
p317_126|a decision is expected shortly.
p317_127|hear what they have to say.
p317_128|i haven't just gone in done a three hour rehearsal and gone.
p317_129|you would be wrong.
p317_130|motorists will buy passes in advance.
p317_131|mr wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
p317_132|i think it is wide open.
p317_133|they too refused to come out and talk.
p317_134|we took the chances when they came.
p317_135|it is important that vital services are maintained.
p317_136|these services may also have to be cut.
p317_137|tony blair's official spokesman said.
p317_138|the captaincy will help that too.
p317_139|we can't have it both ways.
p317_140|actors stand still in the frame.
p317_141|who honestly expected anything else?
p317_142|we are so so lucky so many people have died.
p317_143|movie stars are public property.
p317_144|they never looked like winning it either.
p317_145|a foreign office spokesman declined to comment.
p317_146|no details of the talks were given.
p317_147|the group is separate from the real ira.
p317_148|it was a wilful act of violence.
p317_149|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p317_150|we never got off the bus.
p317_151|the driver escaped injury.
p317_152|t is there anything in the wound?
p317_153|they should be looking at his victims.
p317_154|we told them in june.
p317_155|it's all about money money money.
p317_156|i won't make an official complaint.
p317_157|some realism was needed about time resources and management.
p317_158|the research is published in the journal nature.
p317_159|she is a double victim.
p317_160|how can you not react?
p317_161|they make a selective perception process.
p317_162|there can be no compromise on that demand.
p317_163|i am totally devoted to this job.
p317_164|the whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p317_165|there was an e mail.
p317_166|that is a lot of writing.
p317_167|i try to be open to experience.
p317_168|sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p317_169|we have the experience the courses and an abundance of confidence.
p317_170|it is no place for a poet.
p317_171|this is excellent value for money.
p317_172|each day is a new beginning.
p317_173|my daughter is an adult.
p317_174|it obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p317_175|they are difficult awards to decide.
p317_176|thereafter he left scotland.
p317_177|we've come from a long way back.
p317_178|a lot of things can go wrong.
p317_179|i was delighted with robbie.
p317_180|he seemed to lose his focus.
p317_181|i'll just do my best.
p317_182|three penalties were given.
p317_183|and the world cup has not even begun.
p317_184|the police were called in.
p317_185|the group would never be the same again.
p317_186|aye but who do you really support?
p317_187|she was eight months pregnant at the time.
p317_188|this is not a birthday party.
p317_189|this makes no sense
p317_190|it's a drop in the bucket.
p317_191|i've had a hard time to be honest.
p317_192|he said that this is beautiful.
p317_193|during the communist time they were very privileged.
p317_194|that option cannot be ruled out.
p317_195|women were mostly notable by their absence.
p317_196|everyone needs a holiday even the salvation army.
p317_197|crucially though united were still alive.
p317_198|three years probation is just a joke.
p317_199|that's how she wants to remember him.
p317_200|how do you respond to losing your child?
p317_201|who is the employer?
p317_202|this is the biggest thing in the world isn't it?
p317_203|mr smith was dismissive.
p317_204|mcmaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p317_205|pressure of work is no excuse.
p317_206|on this form they have a real chance of going up.
p317_207|two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p317_208|would he be able to live with that?
p317_209|however what is his calibre?
p317_210|i could hardly keep up with professor mckean.
p317_211|our plans for dunfermline have not changed.
p317_212|it's a production company.
p317_213|no other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p317_214|she died in middle age.
p317_215|they do the work you know.
p317_216|there will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p317_217|we are in the hat.
p317_218|we were a load of rubbish.
p317_219|thus far we have received no complaints.
p317_220|i haven't made the donation yet.
p317_221|other people also tried.
p317_222|but harry has become a franchise.
p317_223|he is at war with his knee.
p317_224|i could go on but none of these things is true.
p317_225|i can't deny that fact.
p317_226|clubs can only do so much.
p317_227|it's unsafe for society.
p317_228|seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p317_229|it would have very little impact on them.
p317_230|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p317_231|but in the end he did and blew him away.
p317_232|i will be having talks with the workforce.
p317_233|i don't care to recall it.
p317_234|that's the whole idea.
p317_235|they showed a lot of heart.
p317_236|michael he is running
p317_237|my life is a mess.
p317_238|he did not report it.
p317_239|you must be ready to play anyone.
p317_240|for example they could be in school uniform.
p317_241|surely the panel was interested?
p317_242|they were even being used by primary pupils.
p317_243|it's like english in its underwear.
p317_244|this event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p317_245|i now know that from memory.
p317_246|we need to tighten up.
p317_247|i saw it at a ruck.
p317_248|this is a huge event.
p317_249|just get on with your job.
p317_250|today however half of them get this financial help.
p317_251|that decision was applauded by williamson.
p317_252|you are not going in blind.
p317_253|they just made me feel dizzy.
p317_254|he must have sat down relieved it was over.
p317_255|he will do so today in monte carlo.
p317_256|the man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p317_257|health care workers and labourers followed.
p317_258|blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p317_259|we have great confidence in derek.
p317_260|it puts the thought out for other people to think about.
p317_261|we are not too surprised.
p317_262|there were no new cases yesterday.
p317_263|if only the problems concerned the players.
p317_264|it will be an eye for an eye.
p317_265|whatever happened to that one?
p317_266|there were no proposals on the table.
p317_267|i have spoken to head office.
p317_268|here the national gallery has been very clever.
p317_269|do you want a cup of tea.
p317_270|three further cases were confirmed yesterday in scotland.
p317_271|we have all been shocked by her death.
p317_272|we are asking the council to think again.
p317_273|we are committed to urgent action.
p317_274|hopefully now we're getting it.
p317_275|i am totally surprised.
p317_276|last year's winner was sergio garcia.
p317_277|but someone forgot to tell the chechens.
p317_278|the bookies have got it about right.
p317_279|there's not much money in cycling.
p317_280|it was always open for extension.
p317_281|i think we're very different.
p317_282|for starters many of the scotland team didn't turn up.
p317_283|the way forward is working with other disciplines.
p317_284|and that is not a bad idea.
p317_285|he also has a house in italy.
p317_286|blood samples were taken.
p317_287|in spite of recent advances the language is still under threat.
p317_288|scotland need to work on two key areas.
p317_289|it's so creative and different.
p317_290|they are in care for a reason.
p317_291|they refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p317_292|in my opinion it was a mistake and never on purpose.
p317_293|obviously airbus is one of these.
p317_294|it got no better.
p317_295|i keep my fingers crossed.
p317_296|some were close to tears.
p317_297|it would then be up to the judge.
p317_298|was all this really just five months ago?
p317_299|some reports said they had been killed.
p317_300|this is the start of a new campaign.
p317_301|it is scheduled to go ahead next saturday.
p317_302|the failings are serious.
p317_303|it is like a bereavement.
p317_304|i shouldn't have to put up with it.
p317_305|it could have been just a quick fix.
p317_306|i got on very well with allan.
p317_307|that has given me great confidence.
p317_308|this is a dream come true for me.
p317_309|no other country has ever won this tournament.
p317_310|however there could be more bad weather to come.
p317_311|he was lying face down in the water.
p317_312|he confirmed there had been no warning.
p317_313|ferguson did not hesitate.
p317_314|managers and clinicians must work together.
p317_315|they didn't have a care in the world.
p317_316|i was in the zone in the morning.
p317_317|he urged people to forgive.
p317_318|in fact it might just be beginning.
p317_319|so he is open to ideas.
p317_320|central to their cause was barry nicholson.
p317_321|not that anyone has actually suffered for her art.
p317_322|there is no right to appeal.
p317_323|we are expected to do better than before.
p317_324|the orchestra is quite good but the hall is terrible.
p317_325|i am not even thinking about that.
p317_326|scotland is one of the favourites with glasgow to the fore.
p317_327|the world trade centre was our main street.
p317_328|it is good for their eyesight.
p317_329|i feel it is very irrational.
p317_330|it wasn't a flashy performance it was very workmanlike.
p317_331|it is still with ministers.
p317_332|the effect was almost magical.
p317_333|everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p317_334|we are not doing the today programme.
p317_335|it's not that difficult it really isn't.
p317_336|she was charged with perjury.
p317_337|i was not a joiner.
p317_338|the sleeper was six hours late.
p317_339|tax is a matter for national governments.
p317_340|stewart will travel with some confidence.
p317_341|sunday's game was not a trial.
p317_342|they were average apart together superb.
p317_343|iain duncan smith is wrong.
p317_344|this isn't a betrayal of public services it's their renewal.
p317_345|that never seemed likely.
p317_346|a decision is expected next march.
p317_347|we don't believe anything anymore.
p317_348|i am awaiting a reply.
p317_349|there was no need for such a hostel.
p317_350|this comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p317_351|mind you he hasn't been back for ages.
p317_352|there's no doubt about it.
p317_353|it just came into my head that day.
p317_354|we've always had a very positive attitude.
p317_355|what's a boy to do?
p317_356|we're not an employment agency.
p317_357|the other was the tabloids.
p317_358|they should be swept away.
p317_359|they thought the set up there was unfair.
p317_360|i am saddened to hear of the accident.
p317_361|we want to replicate that success.
p317_362|we were lucky to have survived.
p317_363|suddenly it was indeed a new ball game.
p317_364|i am very happy to be here.
p317_365|he would help me with the form.
p317_366|we could easily be cut again.
p317_367|that meant the search was unlawful.
p317_368|and he goes with it.
p317_369|the actors just have to say so.
p317_370|someone else can do the cooking that night.
p317_371|i am so lucky for that.
p317_372|it broke up my marriage.
p317_373|he planned to relocate to scotland probably edinburgh.
p317_374|the minister is the engineer.
p317_375|after that it's a step into the unknown.
p317_376|i think it was briefly considered.
p317_377|and rangers think they have problems.
p317_378|we talk to each other about these matters.
p317_379|it's a hidden problem.
p317_380|they serve a multitude of purposes.
p317_381|there will be two other areas of contention.
p317_382|i lost a part of me.
p317_383|surely if anything it would be the other way round.
p317_384|two years ago the commission did not want to get involved.
p317_385|but he has strong links to labour.
p317_386|bob dylan is getting old.
p317_387|i never thought it would take this long.
p317_388|and he is immensely loyal.
p317_389|it will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p317_390|they think that it matters but it doesn't.
p317_391|this looks like it is anything but open.
p317_392|my only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p317_393|she kept him on a string.
p317_394|the committees are due to report next year.
p317_395|it's a long term solution.
p317_396|that doesn't mean the cabinet has to endorse.
p317_397|what's the theme?
p317_398|he takes his time and won't be rushed.
p317_399|it shows that painting is still relevant.
p317_400|it's a very special unit.
p317_401|the deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p317_402|davis is very supportive as a director.
p317_403|however the groups denied the claims.
p317_404|it's only tackling congestion.
p317_405|and our game is about going forward.
p317_406|they will have to cut through the roof.
p317_407|then there's one where people play for fun.
p317_408|that's the law of the land.
p317_409|they have enough intrusion at the time.
p317_410|what's wrong with that?
p317_411|this wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
p317_412|then one night only three people turn up.
p317_413|the parents will have a great time too.
p317_414|now we see the impact of global politics.
p317_415|the figures are bad but not that bad.
p317_416|this was not the show for me.
p317_417|the police have to act to help them.
p317_418|she was extremely rigid.
p317_419|neither side can win this war.
p317_420|borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p317_421|we do not at the moment have a shortage.
p317_422|appointments should be made on merit.
p317_423|manchester united are the classic example.
p318_001|please call stella.
p318_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p318_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we can go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p318_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p318_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p318_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p318_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p318_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p318_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p318_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p318_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p318_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p318_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p318_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p318_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p318_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p318_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p318_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p318_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p318_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p318_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p318_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p318_025|they will be dealt with.
p318_026|it is never an easy game.
p318_027|this year it will be billy crystal.
p318_028|i intend to raise the matter there.
p318_029|however it's good to turn the page.
p318_030|we have to put this behind us.
p318_031|i thought it was quite good.
p318_032|it was important to win the singles.
p318_033|this is a disaster averted for scotland.
p318_034|that is impressive by any standards.
p318_035|we are doing very well as we are.
p318_036|the waiting is over well almost.
p318_037|this was the performance and the result they needed.
p318_038|i'm not allowed to say that of course.
p318_039|it helped to get me noticed.
p318_040|they hit me in the head.
p318_041|but he is not using them.
p318_042|that though was just the start of it.
p318_043|we are not moving in.
p318_044|we have not had a formal request.
p318_045|i never had a childhood.
p318_046|its effect on humans is not yet known.
p318_047|we offered something different.
p318_048|we were very much a happy family.
p318_049|he was critically ill in hospital last night.
p318_050|my brother is buried under there.
p318_051|their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p318_052|what were they?
p318_053|it was large enough to fit the wall.
p318_054|he will be judged by his actions.
p318_055|her role in it was small.
p318_056|i have really noticed that this week.
p318_057|we might be back next year.
p318_058|in a way he was.
p318_059|it's back to how it used to be.
p318_060|it is not a standing army.
p318_061|the firm was down and almost out.
p318_062|they said they were only young men.
p318_063|i was chosen to do this.
p318_064|i learned a lot from that.
p318_065|the house was so well alight.
p318_066|he got his degree.
p318_067|sandy was very active.
p318_068|however there is great potential in this right.
p318_069|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p318_070|i am confident of the outcome this week.
p318_071|there were no formal announcements.
p318_072|before the games it was pretty open.
p318_073|it really has left the town in shock.
p318_074|but you can go beyond that condition.
p318_075|i'm so worried about the roads.
p318_076|this was much worse.
p318_077|he was convicted at glasgow sheriff court.
p318_078|we are confident of taking that back.
p318_079|they must be kept on the ground.
p318_080|did they give any good advice?
p318_081|who wants to be a millionaire?
p318_082|this does not help.
p318_083|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p318_084|that's why the ministers resigned.
p318_085|he has lost confidence and weight.
p318_086|this process of attrition is expected to continue.
p318_087|dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p318_088|this could be her way forward.
p318_089|this gives us a lot of practice.
p318_090|the parliament will make its own decisions.
p318_091|it's a very very special day.
p318_092|the crucial strike was yet to come.
p318_093|there's also the point.
p318_094|it was forced to divert.
p318_095|of course we know them from their work in the theatre.
p318_096|that's the national grid.
p318_097|but allen is deadly serious.
p318_098|peter doesn't want to leave.
p318_099|he wouldn't allow that to happen.
p318_100|they have just got to believe in themselves.
p318_101|this is my personal assessment.
p318_102|there was no trouble at all.
p318_103|although you never know.
p318_104|we shall be victorious.
p318_105|the quality of work is very impressive.
p318_106|however he added there were signs of progress.
p318_107|pitt of course would play the lead singer.
p318_108|i think the scottish bid is very strong.
p318_109|nothing is being offered in exchange.
p318_110|i took the gun.
p318_111|it's just one of those things.
p318_112|a web site is planned for november.
p318_113|we played so well at times.
p318_114|i was very fortunate.
p318_115|such a policy would be a disaster.
p318_116|we act because we must.
p318_117|they will be destroyed.
p318_118|we didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p318_119|o neill is reputed to have replied.
p318_120|the tory party will last.
p318_121|it was a journey into a new life.
p318_122|it's a way of making a mark.
p318_123|there is a great carry over value.
p318_124|life as many people know it in other words.
p318_125|i was a spectator that is as far as it goes.
p318_126|what's the point?
p318_127|why is this?
p318_128|what has changed since then?
p318_129|raymond was always on the outside.
p318_130|we need to make more inquiries about that.
p318_131|i'd love to be at the world cup.
p318_132|he is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p318_133|i am sorry to hear this news.
p318_134|at some point the bill will be presented.
p318_135|i mean it happens.
p318_136|this week is a perfect example.
p318_137|this performance has given my confidence a boost.
p318_138|receiving this medal is an honour.
p318_139|sub not used mcculloch.
p318_140|but every two minutes it was exploding.
p318_141|that sort of thing is long gone.
p318_142|it is typical of me.
p318_143|however consumers may take a different view.
p318_144|they played it like a cup final.
p318_145|however it is not all bad news for women.
p318_146|but the championship is not over yet.
p318_147|we haven't found out anything different.
p318_148|a review of the decision is being sought.
p318_149|it will be about commitment not compliance.
p318_150|still in the end it was a fair result.
p318_151|surely it can do better than that?
p318_152|i am ashamed of them.
p318_153|glasgow however did not get a mention.
p318_154|the salary changes are long overdue.
p318_155|i like an idiot agreed.
p318_156|if so we want to hear from them.
p318_157|i am not blaming audiences.
p318_158|who was on the panel?
p318_159|they may differ on other issues.
p318_160|he had never run the distance before.
p318_161|i can make one further announcement.
p318_162|the general election is all to play for.
p318_163|it was a fiery game.
p318_164|agents and coaches must be paid.
p318_165|golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p318_166|obviously a lot has changed for me since then.
p318_167|it will not be easy for him.
p318_168|this one is a special case.
p318_169|but what are the songs about?
p318_170|there is a simmering anger out there.
p318_171|the ministers are now to make their decision.
p318_172|that is not a position they enjoy.
p318_173|the stadium was full.
p318_174|dewar is the medium.
p318_175|it was that kind of night.
p318_176|it is very much a matter for them.
p318_177|perhaps it is jealousy.
p318_178|any error is severely punished.
p318_179|he's got a great chance of making it.
p318_180|we won't do that.
p318_181|i hope we do.
p318_182|from now on there is no hiding place.
p318_183|i didn't want to ignore the punters.
p318_184|he quit in october.
p318_185|the united nations must act.
p318_186|sponsors include the sunday herald.
p318_187|her daughter is getting married.
p318_188|his manager blamed the referee.
p318_189|they were that poor.
p318_190|patients will be partners in decision making.
p318_191|we have understood the problems for some time.
p318_192|stan is a vital part of our future.
p318_193|all these things have an impact.
p318_194|that will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p318_195|they believed it worked.
p318_196|after that though we are still waiting to see.
p318_197|they should feel ashamed.
p318_198|this is a really serious issue.
p318_199|so they will settle again.
p318_200|how do we get more people in?
p318_201|i'm just looking to take my chances.
p318_202|it looks as though there is no chance.
p318_203|this is not a european army.
p318_204|election results are expected soon.
p318_205|so she told him.
p318_206|a contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p318_207|there are moments of honesty too.
p318_208|it was good to score the goal today.
p318_209|the night is young.
p318_210|sadly too many of them are similar.
p318_211|i suspect that it will.
p318_212|but there's no eye contact.
p318_213|the squad will be the same for france.
p318_214|we are a party for people not against people.
p318_215|bill clinton always had an idea to sell.
p318_216|we are still paying the price for that.
p318_217|he did his best but it wasn't good enough.
p318_218|it is not a wish list.
p318_219|he's very very lucky to be alive.
p318_220|some of the players have not progressed.
p318_221|it sounds like an appalling tragic incident.
p318_222|if not he should go home.
p318_223|we remain committed to it as does the government.
p318_224|there is no margin for error.
p318_225|this was not an easy meeting for me.
p318_226|from our point of view it is the right time.
p318_227|that figure will always remain with me.
p318_228|and then a funny thing happened.
p318_229|it does not take much.
p318_230|she asked us a lot of questions.
p318_231|it was a stunning strike.
p318_232|it is a technique.
p318_233|they hold on for many years.
p318_234|is it the shape of things to come?
p318_235|my body is exhausted.
p318_236|home is in the scottish borders.
p318_237|we have the support of scottish natural heritage.
p318_238|there is nothing to fear.
p318_239|i was an athlete.
p318_240|life was like a timetable.
p318_241|world leaders expressed their sympathy.
p318_242|i tried to push him away.
p318_243|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p318_244|this was done by the council staff.
p318_245|the truth is otherwise.
p318_246|we haven't come out of this very well.
p318_247|i wanted to put myself on the line.
p318_248|i thought they could have made the gesture.
p318_249|we should be rewarded for producing.
p318_250|the bottom line is that this must stop.
p318_251|which in effect it is.
p318_252|the man became a reporter.
p318_253|it is a memorial.
p318_254|we feel it sends out the wrong message.
p318_255|our people are paying high prices.
p318_256|the reason is partly because of tradition.
p318_257|nor is it likely to do so.
p318_258|or so everyone believed.
p318_259|perhaps we should do the same.
p318_260|i read it every year.
p318_261|he was in contention almost every week.
p318_262|every school in scotland should be excellent.
p318_263|it is up to ann.
p318_264|we are playing them at their own game.
p318_265|by this point the couple were approaching fast.
p318_266|i had trouble with the producers.
p318_267|so it took me back to boarding school.
p318_268|they just thought it was extremely good acting.
p318_269|the conference is the first test.
p318_270|that's what we're trying to achieve.
p318_271|i expect a rapid response.
p318_272|there was still more disquiet in israel.
p318_273|there is no more money.
p318_274|my mother is a widow.
p318_275|the rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p318_276|there have been different reports from different people.
p318_277|it's an absolute disgrace.
p318_278|something was plainly wrong.
p318_279|why should he go anywhere?
p318_280|one thing is sure.
p318_281|it was a foolhardy decision.
p318_282|i'm confident we can do that.
p318_283|funding needs to be long term.
p318_284|it's funny how it comes and goes.
p318_285|i would never even consider it.
p318_286|we are talking about the outskirts of london.
p318_287|the end result is precisely the same.
p318_288|we have it on video.
p318_289|i am not a threat to coaches.
p318_290|painful but only because it's true.
p318_291|it's never over until it's over.
p318_292|colonel about this committee that is coming.
p318_293|this year it was a little different.
p318_294|that though is to miss the point.
p318_295|we gave them the goal.
p318_296|is being naturally funny enough?
p318_297|what's the point of staying sober?
p318_298|we did discuss the lockerbie issue.
p318_299|the incident is being taken seriously.
p318_300|so what's the shape and what's the detail?
p318_301|they were going through the motions but that's about all.
p318_302|i can feel the sound inside.
p318_303|i'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p318_304|i am not a fan of books.
p318_305|so now we know the secret.
p318_306|it may well have been.
p318_307|i never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p318_308|it was a simple question.
p318_309|i find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p318_310|and we have beaten them before.
p318_311|could you put it in writing?
p318_312|i am not a paedophile.
p318_313|some of their movement was excellent.
p318_314|but they had to be paid for.
p318_315|the odds are that it will.
p318_316|but then they scored their fourth.
p318_317|they deserve a lot of credit.
p318_318|that is the position the mod has adopted.
p318_319|why is that?
p318_320|then came the crunch.
p318_321|but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p318_322|but will they fall in love?
p318_323|as if they ever stopped.
p318_324|the referee had a shocking game.
p318_325|players are fighting to stay in the team.
p318_326|for a few years we had good fun.
p318_327|medical staff are with them at the moment.
p318_328|it went on to become an annual event.
p318_329|this is the logic of punishment assaults.
p318_330|we are now in an election period.
p318_331|everyone is too upset to comment.
p318_332|three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p318_333|but when we do it is great.
p318_334|she has nothing to say to journalists.
p318_335|i didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p318_336|he pleaded for caution.
p318_337|i disagree entirely with the decision.
p318_338|they've been wonderful to me.
p318_339|i can't believe the buzz.
p318_340|i'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p318_341|the picture is the same across scotland.
p318_342|when it comes down to it this is a job.
p318_343|it's no less intriguing however.
p318_344|it's a question of perception.
p318_345|staff have been informed.
p318_346|my heart is not so sure.
p318_347|this morning was very quiet.
p318_348|on reflection it was really quite exciting.
p318_349|it has been handled entirely properly.
p318_350|i shall be voting yes to support him.
p318_351|that might help a bit.
p318_352|two others were also seriously injured.
p318_353|he was made redundant in february last year.
p318_354|overall it was a promising day for the scots.
p318_355|next league matches motherwell dundee united.
p318_356|you have obviously got an answer to it.
p318_357|it seems very odd.
p318_358|closure is not one of them.
p318_359|the hotel was huge.
p318_360|a handful of those restrictions are in scotland.
p318_361|well you can have a tree.
p318_362|it was the same at twickenham.
p318_363|this is an internal matter.
p318_364|i am amazed at what he's done.
p318_365|they took a risk.
p318_366|the idea was presented to me.
p318_367|the hearing in edinburgh continues.
p318_368|he suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p318_369|his appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p318_370|the hearing was fair.
p318_371|i see it as my job.
p318_372|this was not a summit about the euro.
p318_373|frank warren is a great man.
p318_374|i am a little bit tired.
p318_375|that was never their agenda.
p318_376|she died at her home.
p318_377|she is currently in foster care.
p318_378|that's the only thing that matters.
p318_379|i enjoy the creative process.
p318_380|they were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p318_381|it is however an unlikely outcome.
p318_382|as it was a double it was pretty expensive.
p318_383|it's always the same isn't it?
p318_384|we have been preparing all year.
p318_385|we could learn a lot from them.
p318_386|i can't wait for the outdoors.
p318_387|sure we have problems.
p318_388|i was released after six days.
p318_389|that time is not far away.
p318_390|i may think about performing it.
p318_391|there are a number of possible outcomes.
p318_392|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p318_393|this is the last thing we ever expected.
p318_394|you can't go back and change things.
p318_395|it is time to fight a decisive battle.
p318_396|of course it is a tough assignment.
p318_397|instead it is back to the drawing board.
p318_398|he says it often enough.
p318_399|actually he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p318_400|his primary residence is scotland.
p318_401|i found that much more challenging.
p318_402|this fight is not going to go away.
p318_403|it would have been very easily done.
p318_404|i will never manage another scottish club.
p318_405|the open champion is back.
p318_406|it's going to be a new challenge.
p318_407|as indeed they would be.
p318_408|i want to keep him.
p318_409|he deserves a top team.
p318_410|i knew people on that committee.
p318_411|the next eight weeks are critical to us.
p318_412|yes it gave me a lot of confidence.
p318_413|her grand daughter was uninjured.
p318_414|we never agreed to it.
p318_415|but that night they killed her housekeeper.
p318_416|but it's not the end of scottish football.
p318_417|sightings were replaced by rumours.
p318_418|would they work together again?
p318_419|i didn't play all that well.
p318_420|who can tell?
p318_421|it appears to have been closed down.
p318_422|now that is a good deal.
p318_423|the whole nation will be delighted.
p318_424|we have no plans for direct action.
p323_001|please call stella.
p323_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p323_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p323_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p323_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p323_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p323_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p323_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p323_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p323_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p323_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p323_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p323_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p323_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p323_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p323_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p323_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p323_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p323_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p323_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p323_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p323_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p323_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p323_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p323_025|we've made a couple of albums.
p323_026|film music was never the same again.
p323_027|it was a deeply moving musical experience.
p323_028|now it is much easier.
p323_029|however on the other hand in principle it is plainly wrong.
p323_030|this is the best way to do it.
p323_031|its role is not to interfere.
p323_032|leisure centres were also affected.
p323_033|something happened on that island.
p323_034|meantime the department is proposing structural changes.
p323_035|last year it was won by jack mcconnell the first minister.
p323_036|it is misleading to compare the two.
p323_037|they discussed how he might get involved.
p323_038|and this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
p323_039|and it had two seats.
p323_040|they were not up to speed.
p323_041|we know the quality of life goes up.
p323_042|what is next?
p323_043|now they have found out the truth.
p323_044|we've still got a say in this.
p323_045|the first was excluding sinn fein.
p323_046|horses are drawn by ballot.
p323_047|we have our supporters and our enemies.
p323_048|mackie was at home unable to watch.
p323_049|so what's it about?
p323_050|we have been let down by these people.
p323_051|what's it for?
p323_052|nor does he have any desire to be.
p323_053|how well did they get on?
p323_054|i don't think it is a drawback.
p323_055|he doesn't need to be told he knows the truth.
p323_056|they may have been murdered.
p323_057|however this weekend it will be different.
p323_058|we didn't try hard enough that is all.
p323_059|it also condemned the suicide bombers.
p323_060|i think that's a bit of an invasion.
p323_061|it is very difficult.
p323_062|this is the place to play football.
p323_063|but it was a great decision he joked.
p323_064|then they killed another three.
p323_065|what the department of transport will make clear.
p323_066|the six others were injured.
p323_067|most of the others were in their twenties.
p323_068|we were beaten by the better team today.
p323_069|you need a long term strategy in football.
p323_070|they are not the answer to staff shortages.
p323_071|the law has got to be upheld.
p323_072|advice and counselling will be offered.
p323_073|i mean they have just been a disaster.
p323_074|he's a joy to follow.
p323_075|that is my personal view.
p323_076|he had just returned to thailand from canada.
p323_077|i saw the explosion and panicked.
p323_078|the protest will go ahead as planned.
p323_079|the punishment was swift.
p323_080|who will run the bigger show?
p323_081|general you didn't get a modified.
p323_082|it is a crisis of human rights a crisis of leadership.
p323_083|these things just happen.
p323_084|and within itself it is visionary.
p323_085|are you up for business?
p323_086|it's an interesting debate to get going.
p323_087|who does he think will win?
p323_088|i enjoyed my work in the scottish office.
p323_089|an announcement will follow in due course.
p323_090|you are not in any kind of trouble.
p323_091|it also makes for interesting viewing.
p323_092|will they fall out?
p323_093|scotland came very close in the second test.
p323_094|he was not able to talk to us.
p323_095|jacques chirac the french president was surely in his sights.
p323_096|there is no conflict of interest.
p323_097|they want to shut the scottish office.
p323_098|they are not suitable.
p323_099|it does seem a mystery.
p323_100|but he is something special is he not?
p323_101|club rugby refuses to die.
p323_102|that respect is missing in the netherlands.
p323_103|he could look after himself but didn't.
p323_104|the decision was designed to shock investors.
p323_105|there's always a solution somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p323_106|we are not dealing here with refugees.
p323_107|it's up to their parents to choose.
p323_108|i've had a very long run.
p323_109|it was just another race and yesterday is history.
p323_110|he later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p323_111|football is very easy you have to work for the team.
p323_112|it doesn't make them evil.
p323_113|i have played really well all year.
p323_114|we were a shambles at the back.
p323_115|parts of the system are already overstretched.
p323_116|no passengers were on board.
p323_117|it's like if he's all right we will go with him.
p323_118|if it does it means he has failed.
p323_119|she added it is the same story in both countries.
p323_120|we have a high quality product.
p323_121|a scotsman has to defend his castle.
p323_122|however the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p323_123|such adjustments have been the salvation of united.
p323_124|it will also take evidence from consumers.
p323_125|i have been to see him.
p323_126|i try not to expect anything.
p323_127|i would never say anything against her.
p323_128|he probably would not have added mainly by me.
p323_129|lord sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p323_130|i see no need for change.
p323_131|we are in a very strong position.
p323_132|this will have no effect on the championship.
p323_133|we didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p323_134|it was no more than they deserved.
p323_135|detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p323_136|i'm just glad that no one was hurt.
p323_137|everything was a dead end.
p323_138|it's been a long long journey.
p323_139|i can give no comment.
p323_140|well until recently he didn't think so.
p323_141|what exactly is your job?
p323_142|they would love to do more films.
p323_143|she is now planning a visit.
p323_144|new blood is essential for progress.
p323_145|it also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p323_146|boy is the town a mess.
p323_147|do yourselves a favour.
p323_148|substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p323_149|i said what does this mean?
p323_150|here he is in effect appointing himself a judge.
p323_151|we can do both.
p323_152|what's it got to do with art?
p323_153|it is a very disturbing picture for men.
p323_154|i have come here to fight the boxer not the fans.
p323_155|the encounter was to change his life.
p323_156|they should not have behaved in that way.
p323_157|i've never seen them down here.
p323_158|the motive for the shooting was not known.
p323_159|i got off to a great start.
p323_160|it's the best of both worlds.
p323_161|that is our unfinished business.
p323_162|i don't know what we're doing wrong.
p323_163|it didn't work against sweden but that was the intention.
p323_164|but it was to no avail.
p323_165|we tried everything but it just wasn't to be today.
p323_166|there are so many people to thank.
p323_167|nato has left them with no other option.
p323_168|i want my country to be a republic not an empire.
p323_169|connell was standing there ordering her to get up.
p323_170|the stakes are high.
p323_171|i'm just feeling very tired but it's great.
p323_172|it was not a beautiful game was it?
p323_173|that's just the way the game is evolving.
p323_174|michael is putting on a brave face.
p323_175|we have done a deal with impact.
p323_176|o leary was clearly disgusted.
p323_177|what do they do anyway?
p323_178|the next thing will be cutting journey times.
p323_179|in the eyes of the supporters there has been a betrayal.
p323_180|they were later released and last night were staying with relatives.
p323_181|this is a mental challenge.
p323_182|he was married with children.
p323_183|they prefer the short intensive session.
p323_184|it would be difficult to argue with that.
p323_185|he accused the prime minister of dithering.
p323_186|the game is now open.
p323_187|without approval the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p323_188|rather than just a way in she begins with an entrance.
p323_189|nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p323_190|it is time to come into the limelight.
p323_191|however within those figures income from overseas visitors increased.
p323_192|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p323_193|we have got to get it right.
p323_194|you could see he was thinking about it.
p323_195|law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p323_196|we work for the athlete.
p323_197|it was a good atmosphere.
p323_198|it was published yesterday on the internet.
p323_199|it was an accounting error.
p323_200|the general secretary represents a new era in labour party politics.
p323_201|it has never been worthwhile.
p323_202|she is not in a coma.
p323_203|there is no reason to put me out.
p323_204|we begin as ever with a reminder of the end.
p323_205|so other options had to be explored.
p323_206|but they were unable to respond in time officials have said.
p323_207|he is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p323_208|post offices are closing now.
p323_209|i am pretty careful with money.
p323_210|people love to see this stuff.
p323_211|one film a year is he says his natural rhythm.
p323_212|it will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p323_213|three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p323_214|his female companion was being treated for shock.
p323_215|is being naturally funny enough?
p323_216|lack of pace is his big problem.
p323_217|i have no plans to change the oath.
p323_218|the process itself has taken over.
p323_219|we had a huge response to that campaign.
p323_220|we did not even get a free kick.
p323_221|he was married with a young child.
p323_222|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p323_223|i became a widow overnight.
p323_224|we aren't going to play better.
p323_225|that was the case with david.
p323_226|they loved it and it showed.
p323_227|but who cares?
p323_228|she became a heroine of my childhood.
p323_229|that period was a struggle.
p323_230|i am sure all schools would accept that.
p323_231|i am an estate agent.
p323_232|the conference will run from wednesday until sunday.
p323_233|he is indeed the grandson of travelling folk.
p323_234|is your life a little too easy?
p323_235|i think my game is suited to grass.
p323_236|anything can happen at any moment.
p323_237|he predicted the contest would be very close.
p323_238|who can say?
p323_239|my life would be a lot less restrictive.
p323_240|the key issue for us is public safety.
p323_241|nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
p323_242|i went home and wrote about it.
p323_243|the result could be all down to turnout.
p323_244|industry leaders reacted angrily.
p323_245|there were no violations.
p323_246|it appears to have been closed down.
p323_247|europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p323_248|these are exciting times for young scottish players.
p323_249|people want to see me on the screen.
p323_250|so far he has not done so.
p323_251|maybe they will show it next year.
p323_252|the labour party's not downbeat and neither is the labour government.
p323_253|and that is our first victory in edinburgh.
p323_254|everything is up for grabs.
p323_255|thankfully for me the matter is now closed.
p323_256|we are a new department.
p323_257|are we here?
p323_258|the conversion didn't go over either.
p323_259|he said to me which one son?
p323_260|there is nothing sinister in it.
p323_261|they hoped to remain in the edinburgh area.
p323_262|i've got to provide for my family.
p323_263|it is having a big impact.
p323_264|that is very hard alone.
p323_265|it's a very high number.
p323_266|i was not happy about being left out.
p323_267|such debate is pointless.
p323_268|it is a very beautiful city.
p323_269|the same goes for russia.
p323_270|what do you think of the hair?
p323_271|it is not great art.
p323_272|you do not change overnight.
p323_273|we have to break that cycle.
p323_274|the way they play it is hard to score against them.
p323_275|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p323_276|scotland had great assets.
p323_277|one the acute services trust will run the general hospital services.
p323_278|meantime his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p323_279|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p323_280|have a look at our accounts.
p323_281|we all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p323_282|it all changes for her.
p323_283|we aim to put them out of business.
p323_284|is it a threat to union?
p323_285|we also have to work the dark side if you will.
p323_286|we remain confident that danny is still alive.
p323_287|tony blair should get out more.
p323_288|we need to increase the membership.
p323_289|certainly there is much on the agenda.
p323_290|we didn't enjoy the first game but today they were excellent.
p323_291|he was just awesome.
p323_292|no decision has yet been made.
p323_293|maybe his time has gone.
p323_294|she died in hospital two hours later.
p323_295|she was making a living but her career was going nowhere.
p323_296|i have never seen anything like it.
p323_297|i've got the shirt.
p323_298|both were later released after a check up.
p323_299|we were a little bit nervous.
p323_300|and she doesn't feel like annika is better.
p323_301|however many questions remained unanswered.
p323_302|i first met him last summer.
p323_303|detection is often difficult.
p323_304|how good is lennox lewis?
p323_305|i spoke with just one player but not the others.
p323_306|i would ask the fans to be patient.
p323_307|the plot is changing as time goes on.
p323_308|we have other options.
p323_309|i don't want to hear any excuses.
p323_310|the son has autism and other problems.
p323_311|this makes up for it.
p323_312|i'm very puzzled by it.
p323_313|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p323_314|volvo is grateful to its staff in irvine.
p323_315|all things are possible if you believe.
p323_316|the council's concern is very simple.
p323_317|this was not just incongruous.
p323_318|this rule is archaic.
p323_319|rangers didn't turn up by the way.
p323_320|it was a virus.
p323_321|my mother was getting on at me.
p323_322|but it wasn't to be.
p323_323|and a mightily impressive recording it is too.
p323_324|she is an expert on medical ethics.
p323_325|then there is the terrain.
p323_326|we will deal with the refugees.
p323_327|it's such a shock.
p323_328|the pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p323_329|i didn't know there was anything wrong.
p323_330|it was very well received.
p323_331|if you could find it.
p323_332|such is the ego involved.
p323_333|she was totally possessed.
p323_334|it was not known to myself.
p323_335|he is wanted by german police for questioning.
p323_336|it is a vicious circle.
p323_337|he wasn't really doing anything so he wanted out.
p323_338|we work on the same level.
p323_339|angola was a really hard place.
p323_340|it is a love affair.
p323_341|i was loving that little girl.
p323_342|everyone thought they were safe.
p323_343|people wouldn't have quite understood the language.
p323_344|we don't just play golf in scotland.
p323_345|that's why the young musicians have joined.
p323_346|if they have city backing what is the influence?
p323_347|before the game we went for a pint.
p323_348|the auction will be held tomorrow.
p323_349|there is no credible official announcement.
p323_350|however pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p323_351|i did not think about the ryder cup.
p323_352|i'm trying to stay open on that.
p323_353|at the same time it is a satire.
p323_354|he died at the hands of his captors.
p323_355|talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p323_356|i understand the medical concerns.
p323_357|yet the survey has been cautious.
p323_358|this is a united kingdom.
p323_359|i thought it was a fantastic game.
p323_360|this is a critical time for football.
p323_361|last year it was ligaments in his knee.
p323_362|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p323_363|i think she is supreme.
p323_364|however who could have predicted this result?
p323_365|shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p323_366|as long as it is possible we will keep going.
p323_367|but we're not the same person.
p323_368|there are simply no orders.
p323_369|they were behind the wheel.
p323_370|the pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p323_371|the problem arises because he does so much.
p323_372|this is totally out of character for stuart.
p323_373|pr will be just one of them.
p323_374|the answer is mayhem.
p323_375|but the fans deserve to know
p323_376|locally too the mp is under fire.
p323_377|he asked how they were doing.
p323_378|we have been extremely lucky this time.
p323_379|i'll have to work on that.
p323_380|he must be seen to be impartial.
p323_381|they could not ignore the will of parliament he claimed.
p323_382|that will be the sweetness.
p323_383|the law will take its course.
p323_384|the idea has potential for the future.
p323_385|but is it ethical to practice in humans?
p323_386|i don't have any more contact with airdrie.
p323_387|there was a fossil on screen.
p323_388|i always loved the lightning in the movies.
p323_389|i did not concentrate on my performance.
p323_390|there is great interest on our island.
p323_391|later they changed their minds.
p323_392|this does not create any precedent.
p323_393|hours later she was found dead by ms wilson.
p323_394|i want to go home.
p323_395|he already had had complaints.
p323_396|that however was only the tip of the iceberg.
p323_397|of course he does
p323_398|i'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p323_399|the racist abuse was terrible.
p323_400|the farmer is called an idiot.
p323_401|five officers were injured.
p323_402|you can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p323_403|we didn't make any of this up.
p323_404|ms jackson was not at the meeting.
p323_405|the house was full of smoke.
p323_406|a decision about that will be made today.
p323_407|the early evidence suggests he did not.
p323_408|it is too pretty it is too small.
p323_409|ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p323_410|millions of british jobs depend on europe.
p323_411|we are seeking funds from government departments.
p323_412|last night the row continued.
p323_413|that though was again according to manager mccall.
p323_414|now it's all written down.
p323_415|the dutchman was suspended for two games.
p323_416|there is a spring in the step.
p323_417|it's been a humbling year.
p323_418|we tend to come good at the end.
p323_419|i haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p323_420|the commission is not the only loser.
p323_421|as often as not the cause remains a mystery.
p323_422|i wish it well.
p323_423|harold is a rarity.
p326_001|please call stella.
p326_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p326_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p326_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p326_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p326_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p326_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p326_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p326_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p326_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p326_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p326_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p326_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p326_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p326_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p326_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p326_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p326_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p326_019|since then physicists have found it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p326_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p326_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p326_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p326_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p326_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p326_025|jimmy returned to aberdeen but she remained with george.
p326_026|the message was clear.
p326_027|she is an angel.
p326_028|it is believed he had been stabbed.
p326_029|we have got to attack.
p326_030|i saw the other car coming but could do nothing.
p326_031|united were in control without always being dominant.
p326_032|there we were on the first tee.
p326_033|roy keane is certainly the best.
p326_034|at least two women were among those arrested.
p326_035|how would it work?
p326_036|it was my shortest audition.
p326_037|that was a stunning drive from jon.
p326_038|she didn't tell us anything new.
p326_039|there is nothing like this back home.
p326_040|the police believe the man was not injured.
p326_041|it would be a miracle.
p326_042|we just love to chat.
p326_043|i read about it in the newspapers.
p326_044|what did they think of her voice?
p326_045|they say they feel different.
p326_046|it is a good result for great britain.
p326_047|what on earth is wrong with you?
p326_048|we will continue to pressure the government.
p326_049|his art was not just about emotions.
p326_050|they are all bright and different.
p326_051|i found a fault and worked at it.
p326_052|my position on the euro is quite clear.
p326_053|labour was too busy to respond.
p326_054|his voice is strong.
p326_055|they may yet have the last laugh.
p326_056|but they add up.
p326_057|you can feel at home in china.
p326_058|it is the wealthiest in europe.
p326_059|this is all part of opening the door.
p326_060|yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p326_061|mr blunkett was convinced.
p326_062|for the other parties it is back to business as usual.
p326_063|he will become the sovereign.
p326_064|it was a foolhardy decision.
p326_065|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p326_066|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p326_067|there is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p326_068|everyone could see it apart from kevin keegan.
p326_069|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p326_070|messages have to be reinforced.
p326_071|the success story shows no signs of stopping.
p326_072|another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p326_073|the insider opens tomorrow.
p326_074|more patience and composure was required.
p326_075|it is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p326_076|i was shocked and outraged.
p326_077|it's just gotten too big.
p326_078|we're still in talks and hopefully they will continue.
p326_079|i am immensely proud of them.
p326_080|it was extremely cold.
p326_081|the property is owned by glasgow city council.
p326_082|no we had nothing to do with the jews.
p326_083|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p326_084|they were two different types.
p326_085|chelsea was a great club.
p326_086|i can't believe it.
p326_087|i couldn't believe it but it looks like it's true.
p326_088|we have them in offices all over.
p326_089|it need not be like that.
p326_090|there has been a sense of frustration.
p326_091|at that time there was no infection within five miles.
p326_092|their findings are published in the journal injury prevention.
p326_093|this time there were no such rewards.
p326_094|that'd be good for the whole city.
p326_095|it is honestly difficult to write about this.
p326_096|we are very very proud of alain.
p326_097|around the building the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p326_098|it was exactly four months away.
p326_099|the performance for this listener didn't come off.
p326_100|it was set in a cafe.
p326_101|it certainly gives you hope.
p326_102|if he does not leave he will be shot.
p326_103|brown is an interesting man but he's not desperate.
p326_104|we've all been there at some point.
p326_105|i'm totally horrified by the sentence.
p326_106|our people should be immune.
p326_107|it's a metaphor for consumption.
p326_108|i just saw them for a few minutes.
p326_109|a management agreement however was conceded.
p326_110|it left me with a sadness.
p326_111|hopefully they will turn out tonight.
p326_112|the boys are very confident.
p326_113|the site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p326_114|thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
p326_115|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p326_116|what she will do next?
p326_117|hopefully everything is for the best.
p326_118|two things will count for us in brussels.
p326_119|she has now been registered as disabled.
p326_120|today's meeting was open and friendly.
p326_121|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p326_122|it is the stop gap before extinction.
p326_123|that is a data management problem.
p326_124|nor is he allowed out without permission.
p326_125|he looked very sharp.
p326_126|another casualty yesterday was john prescott.
p326_127|i've beaten her a few times.
p326_128|his father and mother are in film production.
p326_129|this is not a long term commitment.
p326_130|it's about attitudes to change.
p326_131|they failed in their duty to mr logan.
p326_132|yet she is one of the lucky ones.
p326_133|off duty nurses were called in at ayr.
p326_134|that means no more taxation by stealth.
p326_135|history may repeat itself with billy elliot.
p326_136|mr campbell received a phone call.
p326_137|people tended to stay there for some time.
p326_138|holland won by five wickets.
p326_139|his expulsion would not solve the problem.
p326_140|after day one back he may be revising that opinion already.
p326_141|we are not going to forget.
p326_142|i'm the one that said it.
p326_143|it's not hard to get involved.
p326_144|i've grown up a bit.
p326_145|for a moment it was all about her.
p326_146|it changed my life.
p326_147|once they go away they won't come back.
p326_148|it's a difficult one to comment on.
p326_149|our position is clear.
p326_150|yet it does not lose appeal.
p326_151|but what will we put on it?
p326_152|then in came a succession of signings.
p326_153|it will benefit a lot of people.
p326_154|a new school will be built.
p326_155|the main thing is that they enjoy it.
p326_156|it is worse because she suffers from angina.
p326_157|i felt he was excellent.
p326_158|it's not just a male agenda.
p326_159|this meeting is the path to salvation.
p326_160|i think we believed the tie was won.
p326_161|she wanted to move.
p326_162|how do you find the youngsters?
p326_163|it's always a rehearsal.
p326_164|but it's a subtle process.
p326_165|we all have to look in the mirror.
p326_166|there is no internal damage.
p326_167|about the bad things that happened to me.
p326_168|she is a very lucky young lady.
p326_169|it was a great team effort.
p326_170|the threat to rural areas is real.
p326_171|tourism continues to struggle.
p326_172|that however can only be achieved by constant investment.
p326_173|its first awards will do just that.
p326_174|we are already under pressure.
p326_175|she didn't tell me anything the night before.
p326_176|in performance that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p326_177|the scottish management team will settle for that.
p326_178|the us is a diverse and colourful nation.
p326_179|he didn't have long to wait.
p326_180|that was merely their initial problem.
p326_181|i'm going to help out in the summer as producer.
p326_182|it would be really interesting if they did.
p326_183|i need them to set my career.
p326_184|i love the scottish and the irish people.
p326_185|they don't know each other but they have made this commitment.
p326_186|he was all blackened.
p326_187|this is your country.
p326_188|i want to be there by right.
p326_189|the fund has three elements.
p326_190|you've just got to move on.
p326_191|i feel really good.
p326_192|so you think you want to be victoria?
p326_193|this is still a young team you know.
p326_194|it's just the workings of the scottish media.
p326_195|the british government said she was coming home.
p326_196|it's not even finished.
p326_197|that is a matter for mr graham.
p326_198|these people just lost their child.
p326_199|everyone knew where they were.
p326_200|it may now be too expensive for anyone.
p326_201|it was worth a photograph.
p326_202|the processing plant was closed yesterday.
p326_203|for the moment our position remains the same.
p326_204|was this a new event?
p326_205|as agreed the prime minister was driven to westminster hall.
p326_206|in the old days it was easy.
p326_207|i came into this world with nothing.
p326_208|we're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
p326_209|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p326_210|river city is a showcase for scottish talent.
p326_211|yes it gave me a lot of confidence.
p326_212|his style is suited to scottish football.
p326_213|after that he became more romantic.
p326_214|it's not long enough.
p326_215|my view has now completely changed.
p326_216|you're going to take away my life.
p326_217|he scored a touchdown.
p326_218|they finished second and third.
p326_219|we're playing away from home and that's it.
p326_220|he was then replaced by ross.
p326_221|it had not been a terribly inspiring end either.
p326_222|i'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p326_223|she did not attend the courtroom.
p326_224|people can get them if they want.
p326_225|smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
p326_226|he is a law unto himself.
p326_227|i was very very happy.
p326_228|no one should see that.
p326_229|we are going to go about our lives.
p326_230|what is the point of jailing him?
p326_231|they made it very difficult for us.
p326_232|well there is a bed.
p326_233|you write a play.
p326_234|there are no easy solutions to this problem.
p326_235|the government faces a moral dilemma.
p326_236|seems a sensible compromise.
p326_237|this kind of traffic is commonplace.
p326_238|i'm happy with the outcome.
p326_239|an aide was instructed to get a copy.
p326_240|the allies intend to maintain the average.
p326_241|agents and coaches must be paid.
p326_242|the vacancies are in support services and arts.
p326_243|it is just completely erased.
p326_244|his sister added we expected him to be jailed.
p326_245|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p326_246|i've been thinking about it for a year.
p326_247|scotland were on saturday.
p326_248|i enjoy playing with both of them.
p326_249|too often it is not.
p326_250|alex ferguson is the same.
p326_251|i tend not to look back.
p326_252|confidence among the allies began to slip.
p326_253|the real problem is the usher hall.
p326_254|my family health and golf is always a balancing act.
p326_255|i got a yellow card.
p326_256|my game just seems to keep on improving.
p326_257|we would expect it to disappear in time.
p326_258|technically it was a very good performance by scotland.
p326_259|i'd love to have been on the pitch.
p326_260|i never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p326_261|i didn't know what he was capable of.
p326_262|our place as artists is to ask questions.
p326_263|i ran to get out of the way.
p326_264|she's now on the back benches.
p326_265|but there are some problems.
p326_266|it may also be her last.
p326_267|it should not lose out in any way.
p326_268|we're very pleased about the verdict.
p326_269|it will not be a long campaign.
p326_270|subs not used mcgraw.
p326_271|maybe it helps us.
p326_272|three bystanders were killed.
p326_273|we should savour this because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p326_274|however within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p326_275|was it just negligent.
p326_276|he made no big mistakes.
p326_277|it will not be today though.
p326_278|which is a shame.
p326_279|that is where our future lies.
p326_280|there has been no cover up just the opposite in fact.
p326_281|mr burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p326_282|that was enough for the committee.
p326_283|we will be homeless.
p326_284|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p326_285|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p326_286|sure this is a very important event for me.
p326_287|we have to focus on what is important.
p326_288|they have to work so hard.
p326_289|but their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p326_290|well was it?
p326_291|that's my big challenge.
p326_292|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p326_293|we have to adapt to this level.
p326_294|so what is it with nato?
p326_295|we won't let you down.
p326_296|inclusion and autism is it working?
p326_297|there's a strong involvement.
p326_298|the observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
p326_299|he was visited by uk consular officials.
p326_300|so we shall remain vigilant and keep the pressure on him.
p326_301|english is the language of pop music.
p326_302|the israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p326_303|it is a simple equation.
p326_304|it makes a huge difference.
p326_305|by that time however it was already too late.
p326_306|she has seen or heard it all.
p326_307|which scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p326_308|could you put it in writing?
p326_309|they play together perfectly.
p326_310|we will meet again.
p326_311|it's a record label not a form of music.
p326_312|the other conditions were not specified.
p326_313|they should use it on the catwalk.
p326_314|perhaps it is the crown estate.
p326_315|we're looking at the citizens theatre the lyceum.
p326_316|it certainly sounded it at times.
p326_317|anyone can take a photo.
p326_318|we were very happy with our results which were excellent.
p326_319|they treated me with respect and courtesy.
p326_320|he is involved in everything.
p326_321|family if you like.
p326_322|a ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p326_323|i don't want to change anything.
p326_324|i've only met him three times.
p326_325|you see my back has gone.
p326_326|it's a logical consequence of the formula.
p326_327|part of johnny was found some days after.
p326_328|we are the weakest link.
p326_329|it had been on the cards.
p326_330|she looked very very poor.
p326_331|he did and he missed.
p326_332|nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p326_333|many innocent people will die.
p326_334|the mood was defiant.
p326_335|we have now no choice.
p326_336|i'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p326_337|butcher has only one idea in mind.
p326_338|it's our worst nightmare.
p326_339|we gave them the goal.
p326_340|self control is just one instalment.
p326_341|it would be a massive boost for them.
p326_342|you never had it so good.
p326_343|both are national treasures.
p326_344|the then secretary was not amused.
p326_345|i can't speak for him.
p326_346|it is also claimed that he was murdered.
p326_347|hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p326_348|i can't see him reversing that.
p326_349|he was on a horse.
p326_350|i'm really looking forward to it.
p326_351|capital gains tax is also being reduced.
p326_352|i think at last the company will find itself again.
p326_353|and that gives a kind of freedom.
p326_354|i have also been delighted with stevie.
p326_355|he's on the wrong side.
p326_356|if he saw somebody in trouble he would try to help.
p326_357|my husband was born in zimbabwe.
p326_358|labour is providing none of these.
p326_359|so in a sense it was a government subsidy.
p326_360|there is no musical background in his family.
p326_361|however bbc scotland was not interested in his work.
p326_362|the mix with tiger is perfect.
p326_363|there were no immediate reports of injuries.
p326_364|well it happened to me so it's happening to him.
p326_366|finally action had been taken.
p326_367|we're not travel agents.
p326_368|it's hard not to.
p326_369|broke down and can't be fixed.
p326_370|i'm desperate to play in this match.
p326_371|that's always the case isn't it?
p326_372|however there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p326_373|since then they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p326_374|it is patently true.
p326_375|they did not threaten anyone.
p326_376|there is no hiding place in it no room for passengers.
p326_377|that is the position the mod has adopted.
p326_378|but sometimes it works out all right.
p326_379|what are you supposed to do just walk away?
p326_380|even then he was in the media spotlight.
p326_381|therein lies the problem.
p326_382|you feel the pride.
p326_383|but this is not just a tibetan issue.
p326_384|the distinction is also supported by doctors.
p326_385|i have to keep working hard.
p326_386|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p326_387|art is still a risky investment.
p326_388|that is difficult to answer.
p326_389|a century on little has changed.
p326_390|wrong decisions address in full
p326_391|my father had been unwell for many years.
p326_392|she said she would not welcome the flowers.
p326_393|it is a temptation which should be resisted.
p326_394|however his remarks were heavily qualified.
p326_395|it was like the old days.
p326_396|a great deal has been achieved.
p326_397|my future is in the marathon.
p326_398|then he did it twice.
p326_399|so is the rest of british sport.
p326_400|it had until tomorrow to comply.
p329_001|please call stella.
p329_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p329_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p329_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p329_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p329_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p329_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p329_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p329_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p329_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p329_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p329_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p329_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p329_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p329_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p329_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p329_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p329_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p329_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p329_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p329_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p329_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p329_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p329_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p329_025|but there has never been the time she said.
p329_026|this could be one such case he declared.
p329_027|it's not a solo.
p329_028|the investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p329_029|i fell in love with ballet.
p329_030|that their music is truly truly truly great.
p329_031|i had found my vision.
p329_032|the merger was welcomed by tony blair.
p329_033|but they were unable to respond in time officials have said.
p329_034|we don't know the scale of need.
p329_035|mr king who was present at yesterday's hearing refused to comment.
p329_036|we had a huge response to that campaign.
p329_037|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p329_038|i spoke with just one player but not the others.
p329_039|we're still talking with a few people.
p329_040|we know you will not let us down.
p329_041|he will never walk the streets again.
p329_042|there are big names.
p329_043|that argument has been won.
p329_044|normally they have been a pack of lies.
p329_045|i hope you will leave it at that.
p329_046|we're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p329_047|the bill would be massive.
p329_048|he was just a journalist.
p329_049|they said she had been visiting her son who is unemployed.
p329_050|thames valley police decided not to prosecute.
p329_051|i didn't have a clue.
p329_052|how can they engage with the work?
p329_053|i have been coming here for nine years.
p329_054|she has a wonderful mind.
p329_055|there are just two tournaments remaining.
p329_056|we're into that build up now.
p329_057|it is the end of an era.
p329_058|i have had no social life at all.
p329_059|hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329_060|in short the club was broke.
p329_061|his charisma is all on the course.
p329_062|i am still pretty young in this business.
p329_063|on saturday it was much the same.
p329_064|we're not the tourist board.
p329_065|it was the same old story.
p329_066|apart from that they would not be making any comment.
p329_067|the commons is too outdated.
p329_068|you are going to glasgow airport and not coming back.
p329_069|what happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329_070|it was not the greatest performance but it was effective.
p329_071|europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329_072|partly but only partly this is their own fault.
p329_073|he would be with his peers.
p329_074|they seem to be backing off from that.
p329_075|this will be no easy option.
p329_076|i wish they too would get a grip.
p329_077|i am so sorry.
p329_078|this avalanche is just beginning.
p329_079|it is a pity but you can't have everything.
p329_080|we will see how he is after treatment.
p329_081|i was there for five hours.
p329_082|but then he changed his mind.
p329_083|i don't know why she is not here.
p329_084|they are currently managed by ian wilson.
p329_085|there are no excuses.
p329_086|i feel very strongly about that.
p329_087|it is a difficult thing to explain.
p329_088|he just wants to play.
p329_089|it's very difficult and very worrying.
p329_090|slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p329_091|i cannot speak on behalf of the ira.
p329_092|his treatment has been quite atrocious.
p329_093|i want to play at the highest level.
p329_094|nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p329_095|it wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p329_096|jamming would be equally difficult.
p329_097|drugs are always an issue.
p329_098|sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p329_099|this kind of problem arises everywhere.
p329_100|there are lots of these women in finland.
p329_101|drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p329_102|there is no guarantee.
p329_103|we make good weapons.
p329_104|i'm confident we can turn things around.
p329_105|he lost his job but it was not just a job.
p329_106|the news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
p329_107|scottish rugby has given me everything.
p329_108|it may be argued.
p329_109|he is a close friend of gordon brown.
p329_110|i bought a car at auction.
p329_111|they agree to meet.
p329_112|they could not hear.
p329_113|it has been hijacked.
p329_114|his three year appointment begins on monday.
p329_115|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p329_116|she had been sexually assaulted.
p329_117|the event has now gone to helsinki.
p329_118|that is different from being impartial.
p329_119|both offices were closed yesterday.
p329_120|they don't have to but they normally do.
p329_121|now though he is back playing superbly for blackburn.
p329_122|david was not either.
p329_123|they are so easy for youngsters to open.
p329_124|he wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329_125|more patience and composure was required.
p329_126|that's why the young musicians have joined.
p329_127|there is no smoking gun.
p329_128|the trial is set for february.
p329_129|i didn't play well last year.
p329_130|it was an ambush.
p329_131|racism is alive and kicking in scotland.
p329_132|mr blair was in washington a week later.
p329_133|if glasgow is so interested they have the right to bid.
p329_134|is that too much to ask?
p329_135|i have so much respect for him.
p329_136|each one has its own system.
p329_137|i felt under no pressure today.
p329_138|the devil is the creator of weapons.
p329_139|and that was the adults.
p329_140|last night however other experts were cautious about the claim.
p329_141|that is a job for the government.
p329_142|and he had much need.
p329_143|last night the bombardment was terrible.
p329_144|the other children were severely mentally impaired.
p329_145|this can only help us go forward.
p329_146|that left a bad taste in my mouth.
p329_147|but even so you always want to try something new.
p329_148|jonny wilkinson had an off day on saturday.
p329_149|i hadn't been looking after myself.
p329_150|and really the songs are the key thing.
p329_151|his arguments were supported by mr bevan.
p329_152|perhaps they knew something we didn't.
p329_153|northern ireland is a society divided by religion.
p329_154|the whole experience has left me bitter.
p329_155|i guess it is down to focus.
p329_156|there has been no cover up just the opposite in fact.
p329_157|i have great respect for all my players.
p329_158|his track record is not promising.
p329_159|no one not even the scottish arts council was interested in her.
p329_160|for a moment it was all about her.
p329_161|it will be a great night.
p329_162|sadly the game will never see his like again.
p329_163|trading places was too obvious.
p329_164|what if the confession is after all a fake?
p329_165|that's the way it is.
p329_166|we've been calling for a level playing field.
p329_167|i see the extended family once a year.
p329_168|i am not a magician.
p329_169|we couldn't go very fast.
p329_170|there was even a joke.
p329_171|tony blair can you see her face?
p329_172|you probably have never seen them before.
p329_173|they had previously been on five day notice.
p329_174|she had experience of the wildest places.
p329_175|it is highly unlikely.
p329_176|the show is small but perfectly formed.
p329_177|that is the first job of the director leadership.
p329_178|it's been very exciting very challenging and a privilege.
p329_179|it is too early to speculate.
p329_180|i love the moment of being first.
p329_181|smuggling is an increasing problem for the government.
p329_182|whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p329_183|she is however fully conscious and able to speak.
p329_184|or so we have long assumed.
p329_185|they responded with victories.
p329_186|i wanted really to deal with two opposite energies.
p329_187|what is the truth about the cow?
p329_188|they will want to watch a winning team.
p329_189|i think it's awful.
p329_190|who is going to be penalised?
p329_191|this will be just another tax on motorists.
p329_192|river city is a showcase for scottish talent.
p329_193|it was a miserable afternoon in fife.
p329_194|the government however insists the company is not for sale.
p329_195|it is a scandal.
p329_196|nor should there have been.
p329_197|just see where the blood is coming from.
p329_198|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p329_199|i have a theory.
p329_200|but these were the nights.
p329_201|in her opinion the rich are different.
p329_202|hopefully the whole of scottish rugby was paying attention.
p329_203|i am aware that somebody made a threat.
p329_204|he was jailed for five years.
p329_205|thankfully we have started to listen to our customers.
p329_206|we will not break even.
p329_207|we will look into it.
p329_208|sentence was deferred for background reports.
p329_209|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p329_210|what did they think of her voice?
p329_211|but he's not afraid to take risks.
p329_212|three years probation is just a joke.
p329_213|we did not talk about it.
p329_214|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p329_215|the court has not decided.
p329_216|we are opening an inquiry.
p329_217|i get to work with very good people.
p329_218|a quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p329_219|we find this very sad.
p329_220|four people died instantly.
p329_221|but it obviously doesn't so the government needs to intervene.
p329_222|and we know that because we know the hairdresser.
p329_223|i'm really happy with the way it went.
p329_224|it is a step on the way.
p329_225|her husband had been waiting for her return.
p329_226|i don't think the saudis will lay down.
p329_227|people tended to stay there for some time.
p329_228|all businesses continue to trade.
p329_229|it's a difficult job.
p329_230|several hundred people attended yesterday.
p329_231|my preference is for the single vaccines.
p329_232|this represents a tough game for us.
p329_233|the boy is no longer with us.
p329_234|i can't wait for the outdoors.
p329_235|this is my new career.
p329_236|it really was a masterful innings.
p329_237|mary archer is almost too clever.
p329_238|i would urge the government to think again.
p329_239|it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p329_240|they were on holiday in egypt.
p329_241|i was happiest with my short game.
p329_242|i leave tonight for england.
p329_243|there is no change in our position.
p329_244|everything else is a bonus.
p329_245|we went on to become very successful.
p329_246|i'm delighted with how he has come through.
p329_247|we must learn from the past.
p329_248|we certainly did enough to win it but didn't.
p329_249|we told them in august.
p329_250|that could be at least five years away.
p329_251|that is my role.
p329_252|i have no comment to make.
p329_253|the sense of excitement in stirling is tangible.
p329_254|he also presented you bet
p329_255|i just went a bit too far.
p329_256|and how he kept his word.
p329_257|this is a wonderful honour for me.
p329_258|in the event it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p329_259|he was a crazy man.
p329_260|broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p329_261|that kind of growth is the important thing.
p329_262|i have no argument with scotland.
p329_263|and a film maker was born.
p329_264|it was also put on the internet.
p329_265|the reason is the thought of olympic gold.
p329_266|i hope he stays.
p329_267|he also has a scottish grandfather.
p329_268|now that was a boxing movie.
p329_269|top up fees are not on the agenda.
p329_270|there was a battle there.
p329_271|i might also completely change the routine.
p329_272|today's ruling confirms that fact.
p329_273|it's good news and long overdue.
p329_274|i'd never heard him in person before.
p329_275|from a marketing standpoint you can understand their concern.
p329_276|i saw them not long after it happened.
p329_277|he doesn't do dinner.
p329_278|he has been campaigning for change for years.
p329_279|that's a very strong element.
p329_280|a formal decision will be announced within months.
p329_281|i have beaten her a few times.
p329_282|he was at home with his pals.
p329_283|we are taking it seriously.
p329_284|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p329_285|maybe this battle has been.
p329_286|the manager is there to make these decisions.
p329_287|now she has completed a family tradition.
p329_288|then followed a bout of flu.
p329_289|i have worked with him on projects.
p329_290|we had no part in it.
p329_291|his father and mother are in film production.
p329_292|the methadone programme is completely out of control.
p329_293|it was nice to get a clean sheet.
p329_294|the referee had been right.
p329_295|our young people are leaving.
p329_296|that would have been too easy.
p329_297|she admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p329_298|this is not a faceless system.
p329_299|this is a long term discussion paper.
p329_300|in all cases computer equipment was seized.
p329_301|that is just a load of baloney.
p329_302|i'm feeling very pleased.
p329_303|the damage from the fire was huge.
p329_304|she had kept the news from him.
p329_305|both agreed on the success of the event.
p329_306|but we'll just keep trying to get results.
p329_307|a play is a set of actions.
p329_308|clearly that is important in nursing.
p329_309|others were in hiding in fear of their lives.
p329_310|the campaign was raucous.
p329_311|seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p329_312|but both were involved with other matters.
p329_313|we were in different places usually in cellars.
p329_314|however in october another partnership was announced.
p329_315|there is no threat to them.
p329_316|the time is up for iraq to comply.
p329_317|nelson does not disappoint.
p329_318|the woman is basically off her head.
p329_319|the pressure was now back on mr arafat.
p329_320|western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p329_321|it is high time to act.
p329_322|then we will face the danish champions.
p329_323|he wins the match with a passionate committed almost demented display.
p329_324|the south african defended his work ethic.
p329_325|pressure of work is no excuse.
p329_326|there was barely a handful of chances.
p329_327|that will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p329_328|but when he left the decision was forced upon us.
p329_329|i can't believe something like this could happen.
p329_330|quite simply for once in his life he got it wrong.
p329_331|as often as not the cause remains a mystery.
p329_332|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p329_333|overall though it has been a pretty good week.
p329_334|that is not the way we should operate.
p329_335|the new work will begin in the autumn.
p329_336|here again they were denied a voice.
p329_337|we have nothing to hide.
p329_338|it might have been a satanic ritual.
p329_339|i'll take the blame for that.
p329_340|it is now time for justice.
p329_341|that is no use.
p329_342|there is great interest on our island.
p329_343|but he is frustrated at every turn.
p329_344|our house was very small.
p329_345|brian wilson in case you didn't know is a genius.
p329_346|later they changed their minds.
p329_347|clearly it is time to meet this young man.
p329_348|first is open defiance.
p329_349|that is absolute nonsense.
p329_350|i just had so much fun.
p329_351|it was quite rigorous.
p329_352|it is a decision which has paid off.
p329_353|he denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p329_354|their mind was already made up.
p329_355|i had some time with aston villa.
p329_356|we do not expect any surplus.
p329_357|you don't do the same thing with men.
p329_358|just don't go looking to be shocked.
p329_359|pray that it is so.
p329_360|no is the answer to your first question.
p329_361|there was support from across the board.
p329_362|there may be some evidence to this effect.
p329_363|it is playing long but it is also in beautiful condition.
p329_364|we didn't enjoy the first game but today they were excellent.
p329_365|we have been preparing all year.
p329_366|the position on the euro remains unchanged.
p329_367|so what does one do?
p329_368|such actions are rarely popular.
p329_369|news of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p329_370|child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p329_371|i joined a group.
p329_372|the foreign office was conspicuous by its absence.
p329_373|they probably expected something special from me.
p329_374|but we could not change his mind.
p329_375|we have a team to reach the final.
p329_376|however there you have it success has eluded them so far.
p329_377|the written judgment was issued in printed form.
p329_378|i see no reason for them to be.
p329_379|last year however it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p329_380|i never agreed with that.
p329_381|have you heard anything from paramount?
p329_382|he was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p329_383|he added however that all options are under review.
p329_384|it is a dilemma.
p329_385|we knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p329_386|they keep the atmosphere in mind.
p329_387|there is no dispute with the iraqi people.
p329_388|they did not interfere.
p329_389|which brings us to the scottish connection.
p329_390|it is a catalogue of obstruction.
p329_391|i'm happy to contribute to that.
p329_392|despite the result it was still a great moment.
p329_393|my father died in childbirth.
p329_394|as if he were a high court judge.
p329_395|and that started me thinking.
p329_396|offered the gold medal he declined.
p329_397|it brings together two essential elements.
p329_398|the issue has still to be resolved.
p329_399|he is a joy to watch.
p329_400|we have high hopes that this will work.
p329_401|we are now open.
p329_402|people ask about the concept of a team.
p329_403|who has he fought?
p329_404|the film is about the cost of genius.
p329_405|they've been here before.
p329_406|i want a free vote.
p329_407|he came close to signing for rangers too.
p329_408|it would show them a positive way forward.
p329_409|players were held in equally low regard.
p329_410|he also admitted possessing a firearm.
p329_411|all is busy but not much is happening.
p329_412|both reports appeared in the british medical journal.
p329_413|they have the cash to do that.
p329_414|he was not seeking special advantage.
p329_415|there was a fine line to tread.
p329_416|yet it is all for two good causes.
p329_417|it is so elusive and light.
p329_418|or was it some kind of a ham?
p329_419|we've come from a long way back.
p329_420|i've been asked that already this morning on the radio.
p329_421|i'll never think of myself as a star.
p329_422|the country is in a state of chaos.
p329_423|what will happen if it all goes wrong?
p329_424|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p330_001|please call stella.
p330_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p330_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p330_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p330_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p330_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p330_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p330_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p330_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p330_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p330_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p330_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p330_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p330_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p330_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p330_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p330_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p330_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p330_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p330_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p330_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p330_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p330_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p330_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p330_025|like anyone else he has to take his time.
p330_026|i was backing him up.
p330_027|it is not an option but a policy requirement.
p330_028|surely history will not repeat itself.
p330_029|that was their attitude.
p330_030|it was nothing to do with my daughter.
p330_031|the problem in norway is outside the national.
p330_032|mr crawford is no stranger to scottish enterprise.
p330_033|and it had two seats.
p330_034|they could move in at any moment.
p330_035|there were no reported injuries.
p330_036|i haven't spoken to anyone about that not even my wife.
p330_037|jock brown is appointed as general manager.
p330_038|it is my nature.
p330_039|or so she thought.
p330_040|thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p330_041|this advice was accepted by ministers.
p330_042|we did not even get a free kick.
p330_043|what was going through her mind that day that night?
p330_044|our decision making was poor.
p330_045|last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p330_046|they said we were out of touch.
p330_047|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p330_048|it is bad news for the flooded areas.
p330_049|he moved back to edinburgh where he lived with his mother.
p330_050|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p330_051|this was the classical period of beethoven.
p330_052|he has one son and one daughter.
p330_053|i was never going to play against scotland.
p330_054|any error of judgment was ruled out.
p330_055|scotland had great assets.
p330_056|we shall not forget him.
p330_057|and thought we would get away with it.
p330_058|i think they should have more respect.
p330_059|yesterday mr hague dismissed the poll.
p330_060|this is a big club.
p330_061|i find it rather oppressive.
p330_062|many many people don't know who he is.
p330_063|nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p330_064|one the acute services trust will run the general hospital services.
p330_065|we have to expand.
p330_066|others may be trying to catch up.
p330_067|we gave everything we had.
p330_068|i think it is a release of tension.
p330_069|this is a most serious matter.
p330_070|i let go the telephone and ran.
p330_071|it is also very valuable.
p330_072|we're trying to lessen the stigma.
p330_073|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p330_074|this makes up for it.
p330_075|this is purely financial.
p330_076|i want to help other women.
p330_077|the problem is labour.
p330_078|the way ahead is not easy.
p330_079|i could do a better job.
p330_080|i will not be in dialogue with her.
p330_081|an announcement will follow in due course.
p330_082|i am here to play football.
p330_083|our dispute is with the company not the travelling public.
p330_084|that is the crunch.
p330_085|i did not want any damage to us.
p330_086|four minutes later the show was over.
p330_087|it was an easy decision to come here.
p330_088|i didn't know the company all that well or the dancers.
p330_089|however you have just got to adjust to it.
p330_090|everything has the potential to be serious.
p330_091|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p330_092|everything will fall into place it should be fine.
p330_093|this will be great for the young lads.
p330_094|he needed seven hours of surgery.
p330_095|who said impatience is a virtue?
p330_096|what do we do for an encore?
p330_097|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p330_098|many other scottish locations also feature.
p330_099|there's nothing for the kids.
p330_100|creative expressive football was the order of the day.
p330_101|obviously someone is not doing their job properly.
p330_102|the feeling is marvellous.
p330_103|an internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p330_104|it was more like a labour party rally.
p330_105|the conductor too will have adjustments to make.
p330_106|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p330_107|i'm astonished the men were not injured.
p330_108|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p330_109|gerhard schroeder was the victor.
p330_110|the money is not really our concern.
p330_111|you just know it.
p330_112|wallace was in at the deep end.
p330_113|don't say you have not been warned.
p330_114|some were close to tears.
p330_115|seven children had lost both parents.
p330_116|so how will it be received in the us?
p330_117|the government was consulting interested parties he added.
p330_118|above all he was knocked out by the choir.
p330_119|there will always be someone somewhere willing to undercut on price.
p330_120|who then is going to be captain of europe?
p330_121|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p330_122|some people still think she should be english.
p330_123|manager neil cooper revealed yesterday.
p330_124|repayment is not part of the game.
p330_125|who will perform?
p330_126|it's like a high school play.
p330_127|he was part of south africa.
p330_128|it's much more dynamic.
p330_129|the party will make up its own mind.
p330_130|what do they pay to join the club?
p330_131|two people are allowed to share the duty.
p330_132|they want to avoid a flashpoint.
p330_133|we are now in a safe place.
p330_134|she goes to the opening of an envelope.
p330_135|the reason of course was iraq.
p330_136|it will be very useful for us.
p330_137|he was obviously very genuine.
p330_138|we told them in july.
p330_139|it's like a garage.
p330_140|he will be judged by his actions.
p330_141|no briton has ever won.
p330_142|the answer is with ourselves.
p330_143|that is the last thing they need.
p330_144|was society doing enough?
p330_145|the results are sometimes contentious.
p330_146|i never thought it would take this long.
p330_147|he changed my life.
p330_148|there was nothing else to match it.
p330_149|i was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p330_150|it is in other words entrapment by another name.
p330_151|they have worked with each other.
p330_152|o is there a lot of blood?
p330_153|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p330_154|that will alter the dynamics of scottish politics.
p330_155|his parenthood is called into question.
p330_156|audacious decisions were taken early on.
p330_157|but it could have been written for her.
p330_158|his only reply was a laugh.
p330_159|i'm really looking forward to it.
p330_160|a report will be issued by march.
p330_161|we're just a family working hard working seven days a week.
p330_162|the party lasted all night.
p330_163|i was delighted with every one of them.
p330_164|sure the coe is a cracking band.
p330_165|at the time of watching however it is totally convincing.
p330_166|it was horrible but there is still more.
p330_167|i was proud of our lads.
p330_168|so too eriksson as yet unbeaten on his travels with england.
p330_169|this is not a scottish problem.
p330_170|it was his twenty first birthday on monday.
p330_171|there were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p330_172|after that we made some changes.
p330_173|these things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p330_174|he didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p330_175|scotland were beaten again.
p330_176|glasgow is a tour de force.
p330_177|i have no battle with the scots.
p330_178|the league of nations was also his idea.
p330_179|i've done it almost like a variety show.
p330_180|he urged mr blair to get out more.
p330_181|she is on a life support machine.
p330_182|the actor has met with mandela.
p330_183|euro the single currency is a fact.
p330_184|this is a dream come true for me.
p330_185|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p330_186|i think it'll be a great occasion.
p330_187|he went to see what he could learn.
p330_188|it's such a beautiful place like a palace in italy.
p330_189|a board of inquiry has already been convened.
p330_190|we're not an employment agency.
p330_191|it has all been positive.
p330_192|referees are easy targets.
p330_193|it's not one or the other you have to have both.
p330_194|no government has that right.
p330_195|the luxury has been well used.
p330_196|urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p330_197|billie was yet to be born.
p330_198|she died in hospital two hours later.
p330_199|today however half of them get this financial help.
p330_200|this is a good result for them.
p330_201|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p330_202|there was no time scale.
p330_203|our message was inclusive.
p330_204|she was right about the struggle.
p330_205|only the scale of change differed.
p330_206|that was one very hard game.
p330_207|i think the euro has slipped.
p330_208|we began to walk down.
p330_209|i will not take you out of context.
p330_210|winning meanwhile is headed back to new york city.
p330_211|the cold war is over.
p330_212|i'd like to take the plunge.
p330_213|there is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p330_214|lately that market has come under pressure.
p330_215|it had to be more flexible.
p330_216|we are not far from a deal.
p330_217|are there muscular problems?
p330_218|you remember how long he lasted?
p330_219|last night she refused to comment on the accident.
p330_220|ordering online was very easy.
p330_221|i didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p330_222|however sharon rejected the claims.
p330_223|i think it is a great idea.
p330_224|after about a year the feeling returned to my finger.
p330_225|but it's just great to have won.
p330_226|we're going to see more extreme weather.
p330_227|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p330_228|all these women were actors.
p330_229|i've got no secret.
p330_230|we talk about mr michael johnson and he is awesome.
p330_231|craig is still suffering seizures.
p330_232|what happened to me last week was wrong.
p330_233|i never made any offer to mark.
p330_234|to a level which we consider appropriate.
p330_235|that is the first thing we need.
p330_236|will they ever reopen?
p330_237|after that date the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p330_238|we have great team spirit.
p330_239|above all the aggression must be stopped.
p330_240|a national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
p330_241|we have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
p330_242|you would fall over he said.
p330_243|we have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p330_244|they should take their mobile phones.
p330_245|he loved his job and working in newspapers.
p330_246|mr finnie however said his hands were tied.
p330_247|they are also exploited by the markets.
p330_248|the principle is quite clear.
p330_249|talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p330_250|the board of governors must act.
p330_251|we must all play our part.
p330_252|i first met him last summer.
p330_253|it was to be published next month.
p330_254|that is a break with tradition.
p330_255|otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p330_256|it could have been a hammering by now.
p330_257|last night the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p330_258|here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p330_259|subs not used fernandez.
p330_260|the question is is that a negative?
p330_261|this would discourage investment and job creation.
p330_262|i played really well on the back nine.
p330_263|last week he was taken into hospital.
p330_264|he will decide tomorrow.
p330_265|it was tough but we did have a lot of possession.
p330_266|over the last four years we have been fairly consistent.
p330_267|that end is enjoying life as far as david is concerned.
p330_268|but clearly it is crucial to understand that point.
p330_269|mary is as it were the cause of her mother's death.
p330_270|that is our main aim.
p330_271|for this government reform and resources go together.
p330_272|i always knew she was funny.
p330_273|however many of their victories have been close affairs.
p330_274|all kinds of things occur.
p330_275|mentally you have to be tough.
p330_276|i expected these kind of questions.
p330_277|the film has also been superbly designed.
p330_278|it was fit for royalty.
p330_279|it is always the same isn't it?
p330_280|who would take it now after all this?
p330_281|i felt really good until friday.
p330_282|except this time it seems he really really means it.
p330_283|i am confident of the outcome this week.
p330_284|equity declined to comment.
p330_285|there is precious little middle ground.
p330_286|she was shouting my baby my baby.
p330_287|he later became a respected high court judge.
p330_288|they were both delightful to work with.
p330_289|it's my delight on a shiny night.
p330_290|if convicted they face the death penalty.
p330_291|it's now down in black and white.
p330_292|twaddle is a case in point.
p330_293|arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p330_294|just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p330_295|there were no formal announcements.
p330_296|for now we must take one game at a time.
p330_297|that was quite an interesting part.
p330_298|breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p330_299|motion described it as a unique event.
p330_300|we have to offer value for money.
p330_301|the eye was badly closed on sunday.
p330_302|chris is big and jolly.
p330_303|it is quite an eye opener.
p330_304|it became a national network.
p330_305|they still have the dirty work to do.
p330_306|i do not want to wait until may.
p330_307|the festival idea has been a great success.
p330_308|we really need research to help with that.
p330_309|we all work for nothing.
p330_310|it is extremely popular with families.
p330_311|he will do very well.
p330_312|it was a cry for help.
p330_313|they also intend to travel today.
p330_314|there's a lot of hysteria.
p330_315|the casualties were not named.
p330_316|for athletes in our current climate their sport is their livelihood.
p330_317|axis itself was created from that exercise.
p330_318|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p330_319|it's just that we see different things.
p330_320|stevenson was arrested on monday morning.
p330_321|i am very happy with life.
p330_322|we are all family men with children.
p330_323|the committee's remit is far reaching.
p330_324|we've had our problems at the club.
p330_325|the plot is changing as time goes on.
p330_326|they were at her bedside when she died.
p330_327|i think we showed that after half time.
p330_328|building an underground for example has proved a nightmare.
p330_329|i am not in denial.
p330_330|there is a solution she believes.
p330_331|yet the data is compelling.
p330_332|lord levy said he started life with nothing.
p330_333|there was pressure from elsewhere too.
p330_334|what are you waiting for?
p330_335|it could have been just a quick fix.
p330_336|will he be given time?
p330_337|you let a lot of people down.
p330_338|it's annoying in a way.
p330_339|the result today is an impasse.
p330_340|it would have to be backdated.
p330_341|one person was believed to have been hit.
p330_342|it is like being a qualifier again.
p330_343|and he's the first to see that and say that.
p330_344|our biggest threat is the bbc.
p330_345|hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p330_346|she is very upset.
p330_347|we have to learn lessons from these things.
p330_348|it was a poor performance.
p330_349|we are very very proud of alain.
p330_350|that is the consistent approach of the government.
p330_351|there was no sign that anything was amiss.
p330_352|it didn't help him as far as we had seen.
p330_353|head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p330_354|it is patently true.
p330_355|i've got my own ideas.
p330_356|the guys have really enjoyed it.
p330_357|they might want to play.
p330_358|the goal will stay with me forever.
p330_359|our people should be immune.
p330_360|it is simple and easy to use.
p330_361|today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
p330_362|english rugby is on the brink of extinction though it's official.
p330_363|it is the way they work.
p330_364|this was another video cassette.
p330_365|the rear of the plane was on fire.
p330_366|it's a logical consequence of the formula.
p330_367|i think we finished fifth.
p330_368|another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p330_369|we know them as mobile telephones.
p330_370|i have chosen to do this research.
p330_371|that's the law of the land.
p330_372|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p330_373|he scored a touchdown.
p330_374|he wouldn't do it.
p330_375|i don't know exactly what happened.
p330_376|they were very very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p330_377|we are waiting for them to calm down.
p330_378|the government faces a moral dilemma.
p330_379|and a mightily impressive recording it is too.
p330_380|debate is not just talk.
p330_381|however the second goal was about to be delivered.
p330_382|neither was involved in violence.
p330_383|but because of the wood no one had the experience.
p330_384|so people will come out with these things.
p330_385|it was a very difficult decision for us.
p330_386|i am not a happy man.
p330_387|was it just negligent.
p330_388|that would open the gates of hell.
p330_389|if only we had known.
p330_390|the line up is a tasty one.
p330_391|he was located after going to singapore.
p330_392|she was my big sister.
p330_393|meantime his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p330_394|they will now get that support.
p330_395|mr burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p330_396|then all was revealed.
p330_397|they are interior designers and architects.
p330_398|suspension will come into force at midnight.
p330_399|however there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p330_400|all the teachers are afghan refugees.
p330_401|what's in a name in this the age of the internet?
p330_402|we think a lot of allan mcgregor.
p330_403|they had given up on him.
p330_404|she had travelled to spain to give evidence.
p330_405|we didn't know if people would turn up.
p330_406|we will deal with the refugees.
p330_407|i am greatly encouraged.
p330_408|they offer a kind of narrative.
p330_409|you guys are not out of it yet.
p330_410|what does he want him to look like?
p330_411|you know he was struggling with his game all week.
p330_412|what is next?
p330_413|their welfare is very important to us.
p330_414|it's nothing to do with me.
p330_415|she has now been registered as disabled.
p330_416|you have to work with what you've got.
p330_417|o leary now intends to take a holiday.
p330_418|now however it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p330_419|this is about the orange order.
p330_420|but it looks good for next year.
p330_421|we will do so again.
p330_422|it's been a long long journey.
p330_423|i have no problem with that.
p333_001|please call stella.
p333_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p333_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p333_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p333_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p333_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p333_008|these take the shape of a long round arc with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p333_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p333_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p333_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p333_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p333_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p333_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p333_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p333_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p333_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p333_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p333_019|since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p333_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p333_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p333_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p333_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p333_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p333_025|he needed seven hours of surgery.
p333_026|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p333_027|but who shot the president?
p333_028|eating was a nightmare and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p333_030|all would be under threat.
p333_031|some will be deployed on submarines.
p333_032|there are moments of silence.
p333_033|so now this series has had its day.
p333_034|gaelic provision continued to be good.
p333_035|bobby robson called him a genius.
p333_036|it's a policy which has worked for us.
p333_037|they were urged to get themselves in order.
p333_038|too many factors are now working against him.
p333_039|his views are hardly surprising.
p333_040|it is time for a new approach.
p333_041|we have nothing to say about that.
p333_042|we've tried every other way.
p333_043|slowly however a picture is emerging in scotland.
p333_044|nobody else was with me.
p333_045|however the report was incorrect.
p333_046|it does make a big difference.
p333_047|do not forget about monaco.
p333_048|peter of course refuses to conform.
p333_049|you can't give in to the vandals.
p333_050|everything was an effort.
p333_051|and does it even matter?
p333_052|this is the same old story.
p333_053|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p333_054|my parents are exhausted.
p333_055|no it wasn't supposed to do that officials admitted.
p333_056|the performance was excellent.
p333_057|alright it was a defeat but it felt like a victory.
p333_058|the overall effect is impressive but distancing.
p333_059|it will come up here.
p333_060|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p333_061|yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333_062|the chief constable is right.
p333_063|i didn't expect to get one.
p333_064|it has been blown out of all proportion.
p333_065|this is only the start of my season.
p333_066|it sounded awfully like panic.
p333_067|i've taken to the hills.
p333_068|john was a very nice man.
p333_069|this is a big big win.
p333_070|the crowd was awesome.
p333_071|every game against new zealand is.
p333_072|the jury is still out on this one.
p333_073|my game is in pretty good shape.
p333_074|that would have killed the match.
p333_075|still the experience was amazing she says.
p333_076|i wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p333_077|they had not been handcuffed.
p333_078|i think we will join the single currency.
p333_079|then it was the turn of the carnival.
p333_080|but the tragedy did not stop there.
p333_081|they wanted to show what they could do.
p333_082|it runs until the beginning of june.
p333_083|all of us do.
p333_084|but will they fall in love?
p333_085|it was different from our other work.
p333_086|that is in the public domain.
p333_087|the hague is too good for him.
p333_088|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p333_089|in just a fortnight however everything has changed.
p333_090|it's a true story.
p333_091|we are looking for volunteers.
p333_092|john prescott is john prescott as the prime minister would say.
p333_093|it is not true to hollywood nor the player.
p333_094|subs not used mcculloch.
p333_095|whatever the final decision one thing is certain.
p333_096|he could face a jail sentence.
p333_097|they didn't take you to mass graves.
p333_098|there was no option.
p333_099|life is about people and how you feel about people.
p333_100|could they perhaps be related?
p333_101|happily we found it in the library.
p333_102|we all thought we were going to die.
p333_103|maybe he will act again.
p333_104|safety was also an issue.
p333_105|that's why he visited.
p333_106|i know a lot of people who don't.
p333_107|there was nobody on the roof.
p333_108|clark is back on top form.
p333_109|he served in the gulf the falklands and northern ireland.
p333_110|it needs somebody to give way.
p333_111|we have to reinforce the pressure on iraq.
p333_112|it is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p333_113|i'm surprised to hear it from tony.
p333_114|the days of empty promises are over.
p333_115|i thought he was terrific.
p333_116|henry was strong and talented.
p333_117|that left a bad taste in my mouth.
p333_118|i wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p333_119|we must improve our relations with government.
p333_120|within six minutes they were two goals down.
p333_121|this was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p333_122|a venue was found.
p333_123|martin johnson the england captain was back and commanding.
p333_124|he said it was the worst possible result.
p333_125|whatever he does however it will be decisive.
p333_126|this is our way to make our point.
p333_127|it was a disaster.
p333_128|it is an interesting title believing in britain.
p333_129|he was back to square one.
p333_130|both these events occurred on wednesday night.
p333_131|i have been coming here for nine years.
p333_132|it is just part of modern day life.
p333_133|a young briton had a lucky escape.
p333_134|our idea is to make it entirely irish.
p333_135|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p333_136|you thought it was a headache.
p333_137|all the people thought that he would die.
p333_138|it is never an easy game.
p333_139|this year it will be billy crystal.
p333_140|no one else is like michael jackson.
p333_141|the post will run for four years.
p333_142|however it's good to turn the page.
p333_143|he had reason to be pleased.
p333_144|it was important to win the singles.
p333_145|that is impressive by any standards.
p333_146|there is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p333_147|i'm thinking what would be easier?
p333_148|that alibi is now gone.
p333_149|we actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p333_150|the scots are great.
p333_151|he now lives in edinburgh with his wife caroline.
p333_152|however in orkney there was a mixed response.
p333_153|i will certainly be having words with him.
p333_154|she is a valuable member of the government.
p333_155|i've been asked that already this morning on the radio.
p333_156|pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p333_157|but he is not using them.
p333_158|christians in pakistan are terrified.
p333_159|i cannot believe she has been admonished.
p333_160|we are not moving in.
p333_161|it was a breathtaking moment.
p333_162|that's been our position all along.
p333_163|i was in jail for five years.
p333_164|there are no charges.
p333_165|his funeral is not expected until next week.
p333_166|its effect on humans is not yet known.
p333_167|i am very very happy.
p333_168|they got the job done.
p333_169|they tried to give her advice.
p333_170|they won the trophy in the hoops.
p333_171|it is true but it is only part of the issue.
p333_172|it's going to be epic.
p333_173|not everyone however was pleased with the proposed changes.
p333_174|it was large enough to fit the wall.
p333_175|he just carried on filming.
p333_176|he will be judged by his actions.
p333_177|i never found my rhythm.
p333_178|i didn't mean to kill her.
p333_179|it is a job creation scheme.
p333_180|in less than two months the women have achieved a lot.
p333_181|we might be back next year.
p333_182|it's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p333_183|the same goes for personnel.
p333_184|in a way he was.
p333_185|this area is perfect for children.
p333_186|no they have not.
p333_187|the feeling between the two men was mutual.
p333_188|that was a hard game to play in very tough.
p333_189|i was chosen to do this.
p333_190|the weekly average was three hours.
p333_191|when he took over it really took off.
p333_192|i have been very nervous.
p333_193|the boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p333_194|there was an element of jealousy.
p333_195|there was no happy ending.
p333_196|craig is still suffering seizures.
p333_197|i didn't play well last year.
p333_198|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p333_199|that certainly brought me back down to earth.
p333_200|now it has been eclipsed.
p333_201|domestic disturbance is currently on general release.
p333_202|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p333_203|because of this he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p333_204|it is legally binding.
p333_205|it has come as a bombshell.
p333_206|before the games it was pretty open.
p333_207|we didn't know he was even out.
p333_208|he is only now regaining his confidence.
p333_209|singing has gone out of fashion.
p333_210|early warnings could help but it's a scary thought.
p333_211|they must be kept on the ground.
p333_212|we still don't know.
p333_213|police have appealed for witnesses.
p333_215|this is a foolish idea.
p333_216|it separates the men from the boys.
p333_217|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p333_218|or some thought that they have.
p333_219|if only we had known.
p333_220|this process of attrition is expected to continue.
p333_221|a treasury spokesman derided the tory charge.
p333_222|you'll get on like a house on fire.
p333_223|two and a half million people have died.
p333_224|it could not be too high.
p333_225|how many cases have there been?
p333_226|i hope they understand that.
p333_227|sadly it took a tragedy to change things.
p333_228|but annika is just amazing.
p333_229|our job is to change that.
p333_230|she will also get a pay rise.
p333_231|it's because they can't understand the language.
p333_232|it is time for a more honest approach.
p333_233|that is very very bad news for our nation.
p333_234|nobody can change it overnight but you can make a start.
p333_235|what's it all about?
p333_236|it is a big time for me.
p333_237|there were two things going on at once.
p333_238|it's something we want to make work.
p333_239|i want to play at the highest level.
p333_240|we are all equal.
p333_241|that is the key message.
p333_242|it ignores the future.
p333_243|this is the subway.
p333_244|altman has every right to be bitter.
p333_245|it's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p333_246|we were hopeful that it would be successful.
p333_247|glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p333_248|it is a weakness and not the only one.
p333_249|he's in with the furniture.
p333_250|there are two games to go after that.
p333_251|however the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p333_252|who will provide the wine?
p333_253|we are still getting signals.
p333_254|what's it got to do with them anyway?
p333_255|but the foreign secretary can cope.
p333_256|we started from scratch.
p333_257|nothing is being offered in exchange.
p333_258|there are a few changes.
p333_259|you're not going to get hurt.
p333_260|the arrow was aimed at the heart.
p333_261|the new deal will constantly be improved.
p333_262|the headless man has finally developed a face.
p333_263|i heard some of his remarks.
p333_264|eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p333_265|it has to be funded.
p333_266|mary archer is almost too clever.
p333_267|i was just overwhelmed.
p333_268|it had been in place since last july.
p333_269|it was very frightened and dirty.
p333_270|playing in europe is the benchmark.
p333_271|i know when my time is it doesn't bother me.
p333_272|that's a very strong element.
p333_273|how much of a cop out is that?
p333_274|the whole region is in shock.
p333_275|it was a journey into a new life.
p333_276|it's a way of making a mark.
p333_277|lord levy said he started life with nothing.
p333_278|you were the kidnappers.
p333_279|it is a very interesting subject.
p333_280|we know we can't rely on you.
p333_281|arguably they have already done it.
p333_282|it was indeed a night to remember.
p333_283|it doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p333_284|there is something in this.
p333_285|i could feel the blood on my face.
p333_286|that's why he plays for scotland.
p333_287|there are no plans to change this.
p333_288|it's too big a risk to take.
p333_289|it's going to be quite a challenge.
p333_290|i have heard the stories from scotland.
p333_291|it is just too long since the war.
p333_292|my wife is totally behind me on this.
p333_293|debbie harry was cool.
p333_294|insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p333_295|we are the british national party not the english national party.
p333_296|that sort of thing is long gone.
p333_297|and sooner than we may think.
p333_298|raised the way you want it.
p333_299|however consumers may take a different view.
p333_300|i know you went back this morning.
p333_301|i will carry on.
p333_302|a review of the decision is being sought.
p333_303|i made a mistake.
p333_304|it is a very special city.
p333_305|a hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p333_306|they certainly do not socialise.
p333_307|it's my favourite place to hang out.
p333_308|i think that could work to our advantage.
p333_309|was that not awful?
p333_310|that was him under pressure.
p333_311|councillor gordon has refused to stand down.
p333_312|he will make an excellent chief inspector.
p333_313|i'm not blaming audiences.
p333_315|the government has to grasp the nettle.
p333_316|although it was expected everyone is very very angry.
p333_317|i would welcome a proper public discussion on this issue.
p333_318|however the referee was not in the giving vein.
p333_319|i was doing well at the hustings.
p333_320|we will just get on with it.
p333_321|we are worried about casualties.
p333_322|this is my music.
p333_323|i'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p333_324|i haven't won the world title.
p333_325|after his birthday scott was very upset.
p333_326|it's fantastic to have finally won.
p333_327|but she's also beautiful behind the face.
p333_328|and now he tells us.
p333_329|i am not changing my event.
p333_330|treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p333_331|this patton will also return.
p333_332|that is as it may be.
p333_333|they did too but it didn't matter by then.
p333_334|he came in an army uniform.
p333_335|eleven events are required.
p333_336|it should have a health warning it is addictive.
p333_337|you encourage them you can do it.
p333_338|the winner will be announced by early summer.
p333_339|i always said no.
p333_340|the stadium was full.
p333_341|cinema is a communal experience.
p333_342|so how will it be received in the us?
p333_343|he was different from the rest of us.
p333_344|his name is michael owen.
p333_345|he's got a great chance of making it.
p333_346|tartan day is not a scottish event.
p333_347|for now we must take one game at a time.
p333_348|so now you know.
p333_349|but at the same time they made you think about life.
p333_350|i didn't want to ignore the punters.
p333_351|i foolishly had done nothing about it.
p333_352|the feeling is awesome.
p333_353|by social devices the two groups are coming together.
p333_354|smith has not let him down.
p333_355|we have obviously got some work to do.
p333_356|which he can do.
p333_357|no it's actually in a block of flats.
p333_358|it has been recorded twice.
p333_359|they were that poor.
p333_360|and we're talking big money.
p333_361|his silence on the issue is interesting.
p333_362|they have two children.
p333_363|with pierre you can never be sure.
p333_364|here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p333_365|i'm really proud of my young players.
p333_366|people buy everything with cash.
p333_367|there was a great support all round the route.
p333_368|they should feel ashamed.
p333_369|i felt we had fallen back a little.
p333_370|both managements are very supportive.
p333_371|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p333_372|i'll go out and be aggressive.
p333_373|this is important for two reasons.
p333_374|i'm just looking to take my chances.
p333_375|public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p333_376|you will not feel a thing.
p333_377|it's been like that for ages according to the guys.
p333_378|it's not just for classical music.
p333_379|this must be kept in total perspective.
p333_380|all of the names are familiar to me.
p333_381|there are moments of honesty too.
p333_382|partly but only partly this is their own fault.
p333_383|is that where we are?
p333_384|we used to keep our business rates.
p333_385|it was a lot of hard work but it wasn't difficult.
p333_386|but there's no eye contact.
p333_387|there was no energy behind it.
p333_388|they could take the result away from them couldn't they.
p333_389|have we not had the rainy season already?
p333_390|we have chosen for the patients.
p333_391|they have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p333_392|it is not a wish list.
p333_393|he now describes himself as scottish labour.
p333_394|if not he should go home.
p333_395|there is no margin for error.
p333_396|meanwhile the business of government goes on.
p333_397|i get very excited by that.
p333_398|anyway she is playing a lesbian.
p333_399|in the end it will mean an awful lot.
p333_400|which means it matters.
p333_401|i think it can count against you now.
p333_402|there is a great potential on this river.
p333_403|this is a one year deal but who knows?
p333_404|she said he showed no remorse.
p333_405|they hold on for many years.
p333_406|after new labour we now have new unionists.
p333_407|however there are signs of dissent among his collies.
p333_408|there's nothing for you here.
p333_409|home is in the scottish borders.
p333_410|officials say the city must achieve this.
p333_411|it may mean more money but we don't need the money.
p333_412|i have not come in to take over.
p333_413|is this accurate?
p333_414|a judicial review is also being considered.
p333_415|i want to win this thing.
p333_416|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p333_417|the government however insists the company is not for sale.
p333_418|i'd just like to play.
p333_419|they were in good humour too.
p333_420|it used to bother me sometimes but it doesn't any more.
p333_421|three months or so later they are returning.
p333_422|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p333_423|i don't know why you say goodbye.
p333_424|appointed general secretary last september.
p334_001|please call stella.
p334_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p334_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p334_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p334_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p334_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p334_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p334_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p334_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p334_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p334_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p334_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p334_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p334_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p334_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p334_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p334_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p334_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p334_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p334_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p334_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p334_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p334_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p334_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p334_025|a judicial review is also being considered.
p334_026|i want to win this thing.
p334_027|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p334_028|i'd just like to play.
p334_029|it used to bother me sometimes but it doesn't any more.
p334_030|nothing is lost everything is recycled.
p334_031|it was no surprise.
p334_032|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p334_033|i don't know why you say goodbye.
p334_034|appointed general secretary last september.
p334_035|headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p334_036|we could feel the heat.
p334_037|darrell was however adamant.
p334_038|he was a member of the tartan army.
p334_039|i think it can count against you now.
p334_040|i wanted to win so badly.
p334_041|it was an accounting error.
p334_042|i had enough on.
p334_043|the offer of help is there for anyone.
p334_044|there were no passengers on board.
p334_045|and we're not there yet.
p334_046|no meaningful response was issued.
p334_047|and the funny thing is they usually do.
p334_048|times have changed but have they improved?
p334_049|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p334_050|we feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334_051|later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334_052|it is a form of physical exercise.
p334_053|plays in dark blue.
p334_054|but by that time of course it is again.
p334_055|it is something that we will put right.
p334_056|why do it?
p334_057|it could take three days.
p334_058|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p334_059|it was totally my fault.
p334_060|or so everyone believed.
p334_061|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p334_062|perhaps we should do the same.
p334_063|tomorrow night is the important game.
p334_064|he's very good at relating to adults.
p334_065|he is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334_066|every aspect of our play was first class.
p334_067|every school in scotland should be excellent.
p334_068|it was a move which appealed to him.
p334_069|there is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p334_070|he will need that machine.
p334_071|but there are problems such as retraining new staff.
p334_072|we are looking for volunteers.
p334_073|i had a sense of deja vu.
p334_074|it was very personal and very intimate.
p334_075|by this point the couple were approaching fast.
p334_076|i was inspired by two things.
p334_077|they follow him everywhere.
p334_078|i couldn't make out what was going on.
p334_079|maybe that was the whole point.
p334_080|the feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334_081|they just thought it was extremely good acting.
p334_082|so we said no we're not going to do that.
p334_083|this must be really short of ideas.
p334_084|it was extremely cold.
p334_085|they use them for everything.
p334_086|we have the easy part.
p334_087|i had a choice and didn't have to do that.
p334_088|they will pass it on to jim wallace the justice minister.
p334_089|the rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p334_090|mr miller is married with three children.
p334_091|thankfully there were no reports of anything serious.
p334_092|we already have them all over europe.
p334_093|there are a lot of unanswered questions.
p334_094|libya is an easy target.
p334_095|i thought they played very well.
p334_096|it was a foolhardy decision.
p334_097|it means they actually control the programme.
p334_098|and also whatever he does can he really win?
p334_099|they chose to side with terror.
p334_100|justice was not seen today.
p334_101|i would never even consider it.
p334_102|hopefully we have learned a lot from that game.
p334_103|we should just say no.
p334_104|we are not out of touch with politics.
p334_105|that was a gold medal for certain.
p334_106|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p334_107|i didn't make those adjustments.
p334_108|we are satisfied with this outcome.
p334_109|we have it on video.
p334_110|sounds like the sixth sense?
p334_111|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p334_112|it didn't take long.
p334_113|this meeting is the path to salvation.
p334_114|of course we make mistakes but we don't make too many.
p334_115|i was very pleased with them today though.
p334_116|if you're going to do it do it right.
p334_117|he told the conference.
p334_118|the sanctions are about collective punishment.
p334_119|we tend to come good at the end.
p334_120|he also received a medal of honour.
p334_121|it's not one for the purist.
p334_122|it may now be too expensive for anyone.
p334_123|for one veteran the memories remain vivid.
p334_124|he did his best but it wasn't good enough.
p334_125|there is bound to be a formal complaint.
p334_126|it is a time bomb.
p334_127|it's a matter of huge concern.
p334_128|this could be a recipe for conflict.
p334_129|we are taking advice on this.
p334_130|i'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p334_131|it was just an accident of birth.
p334_132|however we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p334_133|it was a simple question.
p334_134|some of his family still live there.
p334_135|i've no doubt about it it was actually from her.
p334_136|by that time however it was already too late.
p334_137|inclusion and autism is it working?
p334_138|could you put it in writing?
p334_139|this is the new edinburgh.
p334_140|we all thought we were going to die.
p334_141|and that's good news for the magpies.
p334_142|that will come after the game on saturday.
p334_143|our offer will remain on the table.
p334_144|the world is split into two.
p334_145|they deserve a lot of credit.
p334_146|i would ask the fans to be patient.
p334_147|it was so physical.
p334_148|dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p334_149|he always has been since his early days with the scottish opera.
p334_150|why is that?
p334_151|it is extremely sad.
p334_153|europe is a hugely contentious issue.
p334_154|it was a budget for jobs for scotland.
p334_155|and therein lies the whole problem.
p334_156|he was not deterred.
p334_157|this commitment should be built upon.
p334_158|this is not however a general election reshuffle.
p334_159|the dictator of iraq is not disarming.
p334_160|that is not just my personal view.
p334_161|the investment will be in the food.
p334_162|but he was a full working member of our staff.
p334_163|the problem is the pitch.
p334_164|that's as it should be.
p334_165|it does seem a mystery.
p334_166|scottish women appear at eden court inverness tonight.
p334_167|he looked very sharp.
p334_168|the fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p334_169|two of the team became ill.
p334_170|we have taken steps to rectify it.
p334_171|i see no need for change.
p334_172|three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p334_173|but the premiership is everything to us.
p334_174|do yourselves a favour.
p334_175|therefore this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p334_176|but we have come under attack.
p334_177|the new system will be marketed this summer.
p334_178|what do they do anyway?
p334_179|he was just like a godfather to it.
p334_180|i'd love to be like peter.
p334_181|i disagree entirely with the decision.
p334_182|lord johnston will give a decision later.
p334_183|that is his attitude to things.
p334_184|then came the collision with sergio.
p334_185|and what was that like as an experience?
p334_186|thirteen people will be made redundant.
p334_187|i'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p334_188|no finals are to be contested today.
p334_189|this is not a struggle against islam.
p334_190|that night was a terrible muddle.
p334_191|his english counterpart agreed.
p334_192|holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p334_193|it is in our own hands.
p334_194|this is a step backwards.
p334_195|we may make a short term appointment.
p334_196|he will address the nation this evening.
p334_197|among them was gary robertson from dundee.
p334_198|i'm not changing my mind.
p334_199|i shall be voting yes to support him.
p334_200|we believe that the reason is poverty.
p334_201|tony blair is obviously panicking.
p334_202|we welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
p334_203|the children were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p334_204|i'm trying to stay open on that.
p334_205|they serve a multitude of purposes.
p334_206|we'll have to work hard today.
p334_207|the frustration was showing.
p334_208|shaking his head mr cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p334_209|it is the stop gap before extinction.
p334_210|you have obviously got an answer to it.
p334_211|my friends were very envious.
p334_212|but who cares?
p334_213|the house was full of smoke.
p334_214|the approval system will be changed.
p334_215|so the european elections are extremely important.
p334_216|millions of british jobs depend on europe.
p334_217|that period was a struggle.
p334_218|we are determined to establish the facts.
p334_219|you just have to accept.
p334_220|we must improve our relations with government.
p334_221|this isn't a betrayal of public services it's their renewal.
p334_222|the list is too long for this piece.
p334_223|if you don't enforce it you bring it into disrepute.
p334_224|i can't blame the fans.
p334_225|that's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p334_226|sullivan was later charged with her murder which she denied.
p334_227|but that attachment took a lot of growing.
p334_228|this tour is critical for new zealand rugby.
p334_229|however there was hope and glory too for scotland.
p334_230|so far they have refused.
p334_231|he is adamant that he is innocent.
p334_232|to all intents and purposes he ran the show.
p334_233|the hearing in edinburgh continues.
p334_234|he took my breath away.
p334_235|it's good fun and makes it so much more interesting.
p334_236|i will have to order its destruction.
p334_237|after that it is up to the boss.
p334_238|i never wanted a legal battle.
p334_239|this influence to the audience is like an arrow.
p334_240|downing street defended the scale of the awards.
p334_241|it had won an investors in people award.
p334_242|a venue was found.
p334_243|they are not an item.
p334_244|basically the classical tradition won out.
p334_245|is that titanic?
p334_246|he was to get his chance.
p334_247|so the question is is it any good?
p334_248|i'll always remember the horrible images.
p334_249|that's why they go to the opera.
p334_250|well it's not before time is it?
p334_251|they were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p334_252|the trouble is though there is no simple solution.
p334_253|i'm getting back up there now.
p334_254|check that he is dead.
p334_255|i couldn't see any reason not to die.
p334_256|my players have no idea about football.
p334_257|they are there to get people into work.
p334_258|the balance isn't there at emi.
p334_259|i am getting long in the tooth.
p334_260|they would be wise to do just that.
p334_261|he was sentenced to seven years.
p334_262|that he claimed was essential.
p334_263|i would like glasgow.
p334_264|strathclyde police yesterday declined to comment on ferris.
p334_265|it felt like my support system was leaving.
p334_266|some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p334_267|the weaknesses are few.
p334_268|i may think about performing it.
p334_269|i would recommend it.
p334_270|crucially though united were still alive.
p334_271|charles gordon leader of the glasgow city council declined to comment.
p334_272|she'd gone to the catholic school.
p334_273|where was their passion the power and feeling?
p334_274|you can't go back and change things.
p334_275|we are on a four year mission.
p334_276|this is a lie.
p334_277|instead it is back to the drawing board.
p334_278|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p334_279|its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p334_280|they should stop the bombing.
p334_281|they'll have to pay more.
p334_282|military chiefs were playing it straight.
p334_283|does it noel?
p334_284|adams is surely worth a chance.
p334_285|i will never manage another scottish club.
p334_286|the open champion is back.
p334_287|it's going to be a new challenge.
p334_288|it's the taking part that counts.
p334_289|they married in august last year.
p334_290|i want to keep him.
p334_291|we haven't actually considered it down here.
p334_292|you've been a great audience.
p334_293|he was telling me to keep quiet.
p334_294|by then however both men were already in the us.
p334_295|we were given a warm and friendly reception.
p334_296|he also wants to play in this game and that's important.
p334_297|we have been extremely lucky this time.
p334_298|people are fed up.
p334_299|her grand daughter was uninjured.
p334_300|it's a sign of the times.
p334_301|but that night they killed her housekeeper.
p334_302|i just need a bit of luck.
p334_303|once we have done that the tender will be put out.
p334_304|sightings were replaced by rumours.
p334_305|he is a satan.
p334_306|i always felt they played for me.
p334_307|if they don't they can expect their funding to be cut.
p334_308|they must be kept on the ground.
p334_309|again it's about responding to your resources.
p334_310|however pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p334_311|the whole nation will be delighted.
p334_312|the public have been very supportive.
p334_313|we've got no plans with regard to recording but who knows?
p334_314|no sooner had we got it than we wanted it different.
p334_315|the hotel was now for sale.
p334_316|there are two games to go after that.
p334_317|it seems a little short to me.
p334_318|almost the day after the election the battle lines were drawn.
p334_319|it's ahead of labour.
p334_320|his replacement was named yesterday following inquiries by the herald.
p334_321|i welcome this new service.
p334_322|then it developed into civil and criminal.
p334_323|she now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p334_324|equally he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p334_325|it was a uk wide report.
p334_326|the law should be changed.
p334_327|this is a dreadful day for iona.
p334_328|he spoke about the choices facing them and their country.
p334_329|i will be standing.
p334_330|lara is very very much a girl.
p334_331|it could be done by experts and lawyers.
p334_332|are you from the rugby?
p334_333|the attack was totally unprovoked.
p334_334|the plot is simple.
p334_335|they've not let anyone into the loop.
p334_336|so just what is her enduring appeal?
p334_337|with actors it is slightly different.
p334_338|i think the commission has been very very slow to react.
p334_339|last night was a key episode.
p334_340|what did we learn?
p334_341|looking at him is proof of the pudding.
p334_342|i knew he was dying.
p334_343|he's a key player in scotland.
p334_344|he loved his children.
p334_345|she wondered why we were interested.
p334_346|the story was being repeated across scotland.
p334_347|an appeal was made to the presiding officer.
p334_348|i am content with the silver.
p334_349|people acted too quickly.
p334_350|this too could provoke a risky business.
p334_351|we took the chances when they came.
p334_352|you have to audition for jobs.
p334_353|what would you do if you didn't work?
p334_354|ferguson should take note.
p334_355|we have always been and remain confident of the securing of order.
p334_356|lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p334_357|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p334_358|they've got three quarters of the way.
p334_359|it gave no further details.
p334_360|this man is serious about his work.
p334_361|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p334_362|she was released from hospital yesterday.
p334_363|her mother said she didn't look very well at all.
p334_364|it seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p334_365|the move follows a review of the singapore
p334_366|we will miss him very much.
p334_367|this was a chilling echo.
p334_368|as a nation we must become more active.
p334_369|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p334_370|it is a triumphant performance which defies the years.
p334_371|january is a bad time of year.
p334_372|playing in europe is the benchmark.
p334_373|liberal democrat leader makes the hash of it.
p334_374|they are a very powerful and tasty side.
p334_375|this is a huge boost for my confidence.
p334_376|i'm delighted for simon.
p334_377|his third goal was superb.
p334_378|here we have not had one hour.
p334_379|he said to me which one son?
p334_380|i don't have a problem with getting older.
p334_381|his son is a local legend.
p334_382|i was so nervous.
p334_383|the attacker has been put in foster care.
p334_384|his death was a tragic accident.
p334_385|it's to do with context.
p334_386|this fight is not going to go away.
p334_387|at present it is fairly uncommon but its incidence is increasing.
p334_388|i just don't know where he is.
p334_389|would you take them?
p334_390|i find it puzzling and disturbing.
p334_391|golf is an expensive game for beginners.
p334_392|he would take up the bike.
p334_393|a world away from rangers you might say.
p334_394|he sat down at the piano.
p334_395|his condition was stable last night.
p334_396|the sun is worth a million dollars.
p334_397|being captain of this club is fantastic.
p334_398|i'm sure they love it.
p334_399|i'd never seen a play about me.
p334_400|the track is currently covered in snow.
p334_401|and they all had these other commitments.
p334_402|the report is due out next month.
p334_403|it was nerve racking to watch.
p334_404|we are going to change our party.
p334_405|it's the same as glasgow.
p334_406|this seems like a very good idea.
p334_407|my wife and family are the support system.
p334_408|it remains in public ownership.
p334_409|the master was by then just too old.
p334_410|all credit to them they took their chances we didn't.
p334_411|he added we are not prepared for war.
p334_412|sub not used mcarthur.
p334_413|the hangover was olympian.
p334_414|we are here for the long term.
p334_415|more likely perhaps is that he will stay in england.
p334_416|a great deal has been achieved.
p334_417|some things in life you have to accept.
p334_418|however in orkney there was a mixed response.
p334_419|this is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p334_420|no evidence that it was osama bin laden.
p334_421|i think it is totally wrong.
p334_422|it's not realistic because it's early days.
p334_423|it is par for the course isn't it?
p334_424|sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p335_001|please call stella.
p335_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p335_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p335_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p335_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p335_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p335_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p335_008|these take the shape of a long round arc with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p335_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p335_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p335_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p335_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p335_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p335_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p335_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p335_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p335_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p335_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p335_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p335_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p335_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p335_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p335_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p335_025|he was born in london of scottish parents.
p335_026|her condition last night was described as critical.
p335_027|i believe in the church.
p335_028|let's not go overboard.
p335_029|frankly it was worth the booking.
p335_030|they tend to be easily influenced by others.
p335_031|it's about bringing people in breaking down barriers.
p335_032|well what do you know?
p335_033|but she was very human.
p335_034|there are some serious ethical issues involved.
p335_035|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p335_036|pupils and staff were sent home early.
p335_037|there were no proposals on the table.
p335_038|who does he think will win?
p335_039|he will emerge as a world leader.
p335_040|it opens the door to the champions league.
p335_041|i only half believed it.
p335_042|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p335_043|all the oil companies are talking together.
p335_044|the failings are serious.
p335_045|the prognosis is excellent.
p335_046|rangers deserved to beat us.
p335_047|that though is the measure of the man.
p335_048|on reflection it is more than that.
p335_049|it is not normal practice.
p335_050|but he just carried on anyway.
p335_051|they couldn't believe what had happened.
p335_052|i would not want to be young again.
p335_053|meanwhile the search continues for ferguson's replacement.
p335_054|the yugoslav army will still be there.
p335_055|there are schoolboys in uniform.
p335_056|i don't want to hear any excuses.
p335_057|they were later discharged from hospital.
p335_058|let's see that increase over the years.
p335_059|i've learned a lot and tomorrow is another day.
p335_060|these findings would be made public.
p335_061|it's the most beautiful place on earth.
p335_062|i think overall they were the best team in the tournament.
p335_063|i've learned from my mistakes.
p335_064|this must be wrong.
p335_065|he added later normally it's not a dangerous river.
p335_066|it probably didn't feel anything she added.
p335_067|i go home only once.
p335_068|i am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
p335_069|it is a family day out.
p335_070|on that basis he would set it aside.
p335_071|i like many others will consider where we go from here.
p335_072|bin laden was not mentioned.
p335_073|seven people were later detained by police.
p335_074|the team this year is going places.
p335_075|we should do everything at a stroke.
p335_076|he had a moustache.
p335_077|it's just for me.
p335_078|history is usually written by the victors.
p335_079|it plans to return to this field.
p335_080|he said because people had invited him.
p335_081|that would be dangerous.
p335_082|its workforce is to be made redundant.
p335_083|we aim to put them out of business.
p335_084|they're completely different from each other.
p335_085|he was extremely nervous.
p335_086|hopefully it will pay off for me.
p335_087|correction knowing him he might.
p335_088|i came up through the ranks.
p335_089|we still don't know what's happened.
p335_090|his team management was protective.
p335_091|the proposal was rejected.
p335_092|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p335_093|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p335_094|four other charges were dropped.
p335_095|these guys will not lie down.
p335_096|i would think they are just behind them.
p335_097|you can expect a hell of a fuss.
p335_098|harrowing is easy after all.
p335_099|that is nearly four people every day.
p335_100|there are nine people here now.
p335_101|i like what has happened
p335_102|this would not be my first choice.
p335_103|we knew nothing about it.
p335_104|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p335_105|which perhaps is just as well.
p335_106|it wasn't a penalty it was outside the area.
p335_107|they receive a high profile in the media.
p335_108|they have got their position we have got our position.
p335_109|there will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p335_110|or was it?
p335_111|it is not fair.
p335_112|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p335_113|few other services in scotland are affected the spokesman said.
p335_114|the dealer is on notice.
p335_115|but it will backfire.
p335_116|we kept going right to the final whistle.
p335_117|police were also perplexed.
p335_118|for sure you won't know unless you ask him.
p335_119|britain may now be forced to listen.
p335_120|john anderson the former scottish national coach is still unearthing talent.
p335_121|the final stage is paranoia.
p335_122|i am not holding the club to ransom.
p335_123|wagner was never like this.
p335_124|the plane was in flames
p335_125|we represent a wide range of society.
p335_126|pig farmers are completely despondent.
p335_127|i've seen some of the submissions.
p335_128|it was meant to rival the dollar.
p335_129|a win was a real achievement.
p335_130|this is the high point of my career.
p335_131|that's the sort of game you want.
p335_132|my duty is to win.
p335_133|scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p335_134|we are trying to clarify the issues.
p335_135|these awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p335_136|suddenly directing was the thing he wanted to do.
p335_137|i am prepared to help make it happen.
p335_138|this is not presently the case.
p335_139|it was a moment of madness.
p335_140|don't even bother applying.
p335_141|we haven't seen from the bank of scotland.
p335_142|i do not own the vessel in question.
p335_143|racism has no place in any sport.
p335_144|it's all too short term.
p335_145|it's too big a risk to take.
p335_146|mummy believed in one thing above all.
p335_147|it was worth a photograph.
p335_148|drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p335_149|we're not seeing an image of the person he said.
p335_150|the pilot was making a visual approach.
p335_151|i'd say we should give it a week.
p335_152|the elections should have no role in this.
p335_153|there was a lot of resentment.
p335_154|where is the anthrax?
p335_155|i think at last the company will find itself again.
p335_156|filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p335_157|it's because they can't understand the language.
p335_158|that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p335_159|he realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p335_160|this is good news for the western isles.
p335_161|it's been a good year.
p335_162|we've got the top three.
p335_163|but the price has been very high.
p335_164|i'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p335_165|that nation is south africa.
p335_166|this will secure the future of our industry.
p335_167|it's just a normal life.
p335_168|however dundee deserved to win this game.
p335_169|where is the structure?
p335_170|wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p335_171|there's still time for that.
p335_172|that's when you hope to take advantage.
p335_173|he is the example for all of us.
p335_174|it was an empowering journey.
p335_175|stewart will travel with some confidence.
p335_176|laura is an investment banker.
p335_177|teams are always interesting to watch.
p335_178|market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p335_179|they had been together for about three years.
p335_180|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p335_181|our customers come first.
p335_182|children are using books in a terrible condition.
p335_183|whether this return was too soon.
p335_184|we didn't think anything would happen.
p335_185|he had come of age.
p335_186|mccall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p335_187|we do things in an appropriate way.
p335_188|we just want to get stuck in now.
p335_189|do you come from moscow?
p335_190|broomfield was the centre of the town.
p335_191|it's hard but if we don't do it nobody will.
p335_192|that wasn't for me.
p335_193|i am delighted with today's win.
p335_194|we are aware of the tribunal case.
p335_195|the overall effect is impressive but distancing.
p335_196|we should savour this because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p335_197|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p335_198|he added it is all about the search for power.
p335_199|there we were on the first tee.
p335_200|next time around it will be different.
p335_201|broke the birdie record.
p335_202|i looked forward to it.
p335_203|that is a brand name.
p335_204|she was an only child.
p335_205|it is best value.
p335_206|the text is reduced to bubbles.
p335_207|they should come forward.
p335_208|we don't say there was a massacre.
p335_209|that has not changed.
p335_210|john lennon is a very large industry.
p335_211|the island will never recover.
p335_212|we are not ruling it out.
p335_213|you saw the pain he was in.
p335_214|that is not an easy thing.
p335_215|asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p335_216|those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p335_217|this doesn't have to be our future.
p335_218|it is a court case.
p335_219|she was a delightful person.
p335_220|they will have to make changes.
p335_221|the next one comes up.
p335_222|this fact is supported by audience research.
p335_223|of further privacy he had no need.
p335_224|we have great sympathy with danny.
p335_225|come to that is any of this really happening?
p335_226|both sides have to step back.
p335_227|this is wonderful news.
p335_228|my dad was working in ayrshire.
p335_229|but if they were there they were keeping a low profile.
p335_230|it shows that painting is still relevant.
p335_231|they scored a goal but we have to keep playing.
p335_232|it sounds a bit of an own goal.
p335_233|we are ready for the long haul.
p335_234|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p335_235|this is a big step up.
p335_236|i don't have any answer for them.
p335_237|manager bobby williamson has no injury worries.
p335_238|i look for dancers who are also actors.
p335_239|however civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p335_240|emi is a prime example.
p335_241|the observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p335_242|you cannot allow it to go on.
p335_243|it's a record label not a form of music.
p335_244|not that agassi was a believer.
p335_245|a friendship that will endure.
p335_246|tourism is a vital industry for scotland.
p335_247|it needs to be sorted out by easter.
p335_248|i am deeply sorry they did.
p335_249|nowadays it is workers united.
p335_250|alex is a big part of that future.
p335_251|who would have thought it?
p335_252|i think he was surprised.
p335_253|i played well on saturday and again today.
p335_254|finally action had been taken.
p335_255|then there's the problem of sympathy.
p335_256|he was my big brother my father my grandfather.
p335_257|that gives us a bit of a chance.
p335_258|i watched a game.
p335_259|that was a bonus but it was not the main objective.
p335_260|blair is very positive at european councils.
p335_261|certainly in terms of league position we must be favourites.
p335_262|intensive care has been very busy.
p335_263|there was no let up for the minnows.
p335_264|i try not to expect anything.
p335_265|this is my home town.
p335_266|i think we've got the balance right.
p335_267|we will build upon the basic state pension.
p335_268|i have good memories of glasgow.
p335_269|nothing can bring back their son.
p335_270|it was frightening intense and primal theatre.
p335_271|some may end up in hospital.
p335_272|he wasn't really doing anything so he wanted out.
p335_273|the council has been open and transparent.
p335_274|we can do nothing about that.
p335_275|princess margaret is being buried on that day.
p335_276|that is highly unfair.
p335_277|there is great demand for human cloning.
p335_278|i'm very tired but it was worth it.
p335_279|or rather he did and he didn't.
p335_280|scots actors should be so lucky.
p335_281|government sources said it is building up.
p335_282|arsenal considered the job done.
p335_283|i think it will make a huge difference.
p335_284|bob dylan is getting old.
p335_285|the company yesterday refused to comment.
p335_286|maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p335_287|others were even less confident.
p335_288|i just want to change my life.
p335_289|on occasions he succeeded.
p335_290|he did not oppose the divorce.
p335_291|famously though there was a catch.
p335_292|there are so many people to thank.
p335_293|connell was standing there ordering her to get up.
p335_294|he is also a great finisher.
p335_295|he knew it would cost him millions.
p335_296|i'd never be free.
p335_297|law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p335_298|a counter reaction was.
p335_299|he said he was sorry.
p335_300|sadly the revival could not be sustained.
p335_301|clearly she says she would never resort to such devices.
p335_302|this will help our confidence.
p335_303|this looks like it is anything but open.
p335_304|we are now setting about finding them.
p335_305|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p335_306|if not he should go home.
p335_307|we must not go down that road.
p335_308|it won't happen overnight but things will get better.
p335_309|luckily for us he enjoyed the experience.
p335_310|i am not among its admirers.
p335_311|hitches can be expected.
p335_312|he wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p335_313|the issues are very intense.
p335_314|this time for rangers it is certainly the latter.
p335_315|i feel sorry for the reds.
p335_316|the company's in good shape.
p335_317|dialogue is the key.
p335_318|the actors are confident and polished.
p335_319|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p335_320|i couldn't really work outside edinburgh.
p335_321|motherwell have no such good fortune.
p335_322|but he is revelling in the big stage.
p335_323|and who were they anyway beforehand?
p335_324|you have to think not.
p335_325|stock markets will be watching closely.
p335_326|this is a national crisis.
p335_327|if they have city backing what is the influence?
p335_328|again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p335_329|in europe it is always over two games.
p335_330|the whole thing would be perfect.
p335_331|there's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p335_332|as long as it is possible we will keep going.
p335_333|there is no magical figure but there are criteria.
p335_334|however we had no failures in our side.
p335_335|i don't have any more contact with airdrie.
p335_336|we will be stronger in berlin.
p335_337|it is so damaging.
p335_338|i put pressure on him.
p335_339|meanwhile rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p335_340|i'm the one who has to suffer.
p335_341|with us we just want them to respond.
p335_342|he takes his time and won't be rushed.
p335_343|and the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p335_344|they are the heroes.
p335_345|the songs are just so good.
p335_346|we have rebuilt and reformed.
p335_347|scottish life can be like this too.
p335_348|it was certainly intense.
p335_349|it was not confirmed by scotland yard.
p335_350|he refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
p335_351|he denied that taxpayers money was involved.
p335_352|we were a shambles at the back.
p335_353|their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p335_354|it took more than two years.
p335_355|there is access for disabled people.
p335_356|the home was now under new management.
p335_357|all our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p335_358|is my wife a racist?
p335_359|it is like a theatre of the absurd.
p335_360|there is no openness.
p335_361|it's being very carefully looked at.
p335_362|it feels like too much.
p335_363|it was a job he loved.
p335_364|it may encourage more people to prospect.
p335_365|but let's not get carried away.
p335_366|there was some merit in that.
p335_367|she is believed to be in south africa.
p335_368|its people are inventive talented and diligent.
p335_369|this is the last thing we ever expected.
p335_370|it looks like paradise.
p335_371|this means a great deal to the families.
p335_372|at the moment it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p335_373|we were short of athletes.
p335_374|six other people were injured.
p335_375|they included certain insurance policies and his share of the house.
p335_376|the wealth of talent in australia is awesome.
p335_377|only local people are helping.
p335_378|there were three boys and two girls.
p335_379|there's no support for it at all.
p335_380|even though the show is seriously exacting physically demanding.
p335_381|you're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p335_382|writing has diminished in value.
p335_383|there is a job to be done.
p335_384|scotland is too small a country for that.
p335_385|i am not obsessed with sex.
p335_386|muslim leaders in italy have denied the charge.
p335_387|it's our worst nightmare.
p335_388|i can't believe what has happened.
p335_389|it's about my time as a guitarist.
p335_390|it's really nothing new.
p335_391|you do that because you want to win.
p335_392|we have been working closely with holyrood.
p335_393|from then on scott has never looked back.
p335_394|partition is not an option.
p335_395|we have been treated with complete contempt.
p335_396|i'll tell you honestly.
p335_397|the home team had an amazing start.
p335_398|he became the focus of surrounding interest.
p335_399|it is a comforting fantasy but it remains a fantasy.
p335_400|the conclusion is enthralling.
p335_401|this is usually done by the space shuttle.
p335_402|the review has been conducted fairly.
p335_403|anyway even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p335_404|friends of the family have given their support.
p335_405|you name it they have it.
p335_406|we are obviously disturbed by this case.
p335_407|there was no cohesion.
p335_408|there is no going back.
p335_409|we could play someone else but he is ready to play.
p335_410|courtenay took over on tour.
p335_411|he is very popular in the squad in england and abroad.
p335_412|the game is now open.
p335_413|last night he pledged to clear his name.
p335_414|jackson may well be right.
p335_415|i am in a very difficult position.
p335_416|they will run in tandem with new work.
p335_417|the pain was almost too much to bear.
p335_418|lord sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p335_419|he is not very big either.
p335_420|still the experience was amazing she says.
p335_421|but who gets on the tube?
p335_422|we are encouraged by the news.
p335_423|in addition certain areas are closed at certain times.
p336_001|please call stella.
p336_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p336_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p336_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p336_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p336_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p336_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p336_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p336_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p336_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p336_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p336_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p336_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p336_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p336_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p336_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p336_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p336_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p336_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p336_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p336_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p336_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p336_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
p336_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p336_025|i am very happy with the result.
p336_026|she took them for a term.
p336_027|it is deeply worrying.
p336_028|this is a very interesting move.
p336_029|are we not men?
p336_030|how could it not?
p336_031|it is sending the wrong message to people.
p336_032|another former manager bobby robson said.
p336_033|we are proud of them.
p336_034|we had a really good experience with david.
p336_035|it was another good idea.
p336_036|i want to make a vigorous defence.
p336_037|that incident altered the pattern of the game.
p336_038|it is a terrible equation.
p336_039|that gives us something to kick against.
p336_040|it was pretty special.
p336_041|whatever we are doing they have good reason to come.
p336_042|i should say so.
p336_043|yet therein is the problem.
p336_044|this isn't a new problem.
p336_045|that though was just the start of it.
p336_046|my office is down there.
p336_047|there can be no dispute about our history.
p336_048|the crowd was waiting.
p336_049|it was a joy.
p336_050|it's the same with cinema.
p336_051|it was the climax of the thing.
p336_052|he died from multiple injuries.
p336_053|it is nearly there.
p336_054|i'm going to buy a car.
p336_055|we said what do you mean?
p336_056|i have been there many times.
p336_057|the crackdown is launched today by the government.
p336_058|this ruling is a farce.
p336_059|they enjoy playing the game.
p336_060|it was rather a distorted image of islam.
p336_061|it is not standing army.
p336_062|it was a crucial moment.
p336_063|someone else has now got them.
p336_064|the second is freedom.
p336_065|i let go the telephone and ran.
p336_066|get used to it.
p336_067|for one thing he was growing far too quickly.
p336_068|everyone at the school is delighted for steven.
p336_069|after that the scottish parliament will run the show.
p336_070|sadly in this case that was not so.
p336_071|the hearing was continued until a later date.
p336_072|still some additions are inspired.
p336_073|any error is severely punished.
p336_074|yet what is supposed to be said?
p336_075|but we will learn from that.
p336_076|he has not created a festival resource.
p336_077|we couldn't afford it.
p336_078|i get the bus.
p336_079|i might have been sitting at home with her out here.
p336_080|frankly we should all have such problems.
p336_081|the issues are not going to change.
p336_082|four minutes later the show was over.
p336_083|would you have ever believed that was possible?
p336_084|it will be easier for us.
p336_085|i don't think it is.
p336_086|there are no other contenders.
p336_087|on that they agree.
p336_088|they failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p336_089|but who was driving it?
p336_090|we have to get this sorted out.
p336_091|it was very fast.
p336_092|singing is my first love.
p336_093|when is it ever anything else?
p336_094|it's hard to see it.
p336_095|i believe in trade unions.
p336_096|sub not used mackay.
p336_097|this is in a league of its own.
p336_098|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p336_099|that statement has never been withdrawn.
p336_100|the supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p336_101|that is unlikely to happen.
p336_102|that is a mark of what you are.
p336_103|this is not finished.
p336_104|it was one of the firemen.
p336_105|now she has completed a family tradition.
p336_106|don't you believe it.
p336_107|there is another important factor.
p336_108|most people know that.
p336_109|i want to keep playing.
p336_110|at westminster there was disbelief at the news.
p336_111|the first is in whitehall the second in brussels.
p336_112|that is how we will be judged.
p336_113|it's there for people to look at.
p336_114|we are getting there.
p336_115|i just couldn't believe what had happened.
p336_116|they never got into the show this time.
p336_117|he too is keen to redress the balance.
p336_118|but no it's not funny.
p336_119|we just try to make great records.
p336_120|it's almost certainly not going to help.
p336_121|why does it come out now?
p336_122|in that case the children were not missing.
p336_123|these figures are truly awful.
p336_124|the whole thing was just unreal.
p336_125|they haven't been thought through.
p336_126|they have their own audience in edinburgh.
p336_127|it's better than that it's fantastic.
p336_128|the criteria have changed.
p336_129|everyone in front of me was dead.
p336_130|audacious decisions were taken early on.
p336_131|i have thought a lot about the commonwealths.
p336_132|i just have no maternal instincts.
p336_133|it has been declared.
p336_134|his commitment on the other hand is clear.
p336_135|clearly audiences are unsettled.
p336_136|it's very hard to plan for it.
p336_137|there is nothing like this back home.
p336_138|they are declining elsewhere in the uk.
p336_139|he is that good.
p336_140|we did not have a clue.
p336_141|we need to be more specific.
p336_142|this is the man who provides the hope.
p336_143|this is a war over our home.
p336_144|he's got me very well.
p336_145|he has been banned from the salmon inn.
p336_146|he was always nice to me.
p336_147|he looked at me before replying.
p336_148|then there is the mini itself.
p336_149|this may be perfectly innocent.
p336_150|it's good for the city.
p336_151|the only answer is a public inquiry.
p336_152|controllers major concern is safety.
p336_153|it's like an extension of your body.
p336_154|because he usually is.
p336_155|it's very simple no one is forced to compete.
p336_156|we have waited a long time for this.
p336_157|i want my audience to be challenged.
p336_158|this is the culture change in medicine.
p336_159|who do you think you are?
p336_160|parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p336_161|i have no battle with the scots.
p336_162|i hope he gets it.
p336_163|everything has its place and purpose.
p336_164|yesterday he continued to keep a low profile.
p336_165|i am here to work for scottish labour.
p336_166|nobody could survive on that.
p336_167|i can't do anything before nine.
p336_168|their vision was not impeded.
p336_169|he is married with three children.
p336_170|these days will be back.
p336_171|however they should not come as a surprise.
p336_172|it could last five months.
p336_173|everything is accounted for.
p336_174|the support from the general public was astounding.
p336_175|about time too you might think.
p336_176|however it does not tell the full story.
p336_177|we have made mistakes and were badly punished.
p336_178|the bombing has had a huge influence.
p336_179|we've got a mixture of both.
p336_180|i'm very happy to be here.
p336_181|this is not the case.
p336_182|this one was supposed to be so different.
p336_183|i want the commonwealth and european titles.
p336_184|it has been difficult for her to do he says.
p336_185|they are now out in the cold.
p336_186|however planners should be taking the lead.
p336_187|cloning is not ready.
p336_188|new labour are running scared.
p336_189|it is a good result for great britain.
p336_190|the weekly average was three hours.
p336_191|is there a new way forward?
p336_192|don't hold your breath
p336_193|this is the start of a slippery slope.
p336_194|where do you think she is going?
p336_195|safety is our first concern.
p336_196|in fact it was almost as if it was expected.
p336_197|inspections are not the problem.
p336_198|but who will buy it?
p336_199|and it's more subversive.
p336_200|openness is always the best way.
p336_201|it wouldn't go off.
p336_202|i've been enjoying it though.
p336_203|the professor said the results were positive.
p336_204|i'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p336_205|it's part of the end game.
p336_206|do they play for the money?
p336_207|the train was on time.
p336_208|so where do we go from here?
p336_209|the claim was denied by the first minister.
p336_210|more than that it's a vicious circle.
p336_211|and how much of a compliment is that?
p336_213|politics is a tough game.
p336_214|i have friends in glasgow.
p336_215|what has changed?
p336_216|there's nothing to be gained by it.
p336_217|chambers said he would accept the place.
p336_218|we have been through this with the lawyers.
p336_219|i'm not interested in the job.
p336_220|his contract was then not renewed.
p336_221|despite his senior position he did not know in advance.
p336_222|the warnings were a good reminder.
p336_223|i came here this week to work.
p336_224|it's the last thing on my mind.
p336_225|barry ferguson is one of them.
p336_226|the biggest resource is our staff.
p336_227|we have big ideas.
p336_228|how will we get there?
p336_229|she told me to stop.
p336_230|i wish him well for the future.
p336_231|cars are great for going long distances.
p336_232|it's not a party no no.
p336_233|the lads are having a tour.
p336_234|it may not be life long.
p336_235|everyone was in tears.
p336_236|it was just above the roof.
p336_237|these were the dreams.
p336_238|but we must work in harmony.
p336_239|it's a bit like a bereavement.
p336_240|there is no other way.
p336_241|everyone must be focused on the league.
p336_242|the english are coming.
p336_243|you have friends in the liberal democrats.
p336_244|i believe in theatre.
p336_245|only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p336_246|it's time to say enough is enough.
p336_247|he has to pull back from the brink.
p336_248|she has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p336_249|i don't have any regrets about the edit.
p336_250|that does not mean we have failed.
p336_251|the family baton is handed on.
p336_252|she has a little boy.
p336_253|our policy is very clear on this issue.
p336_254|he has refused to do that.
p336_255|i can understand why they have gone.
p336_256|all my training is for athens.
p336_257|this is a personal decision for me.
p336_258|when will you listen?
p336_259|i'm happy that we have agreed.
p336_260|all of them were killed.
p336_261|all the children on the roll are genuine.
p336_262|sub not used mccormick.
p336_263|you can spend money on housing.
p336_264|ferguson must take the blame.
p336_265|there is no point in denying that.
p336_266|the kids are paying the price.
p336_267|not that it is unique.
p336_268|we're all going to take a holiday.
p336_269|i've got three other ideas for the day.
p336_270|some injustice was committed.
p336_271|i've had a wonderful career.
p336_272|the bbc was a disgrace.
p336_273|i didn't expect to be in.
p336_274|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p336_275|i reckon he won't make the mistake again.
p336_276|i should think so too.
p336_277|if so we want to hear from them.
p336_278|it's not covered by the insurance.
p336_279|he denied the charge.
p336_280|i was shaking on the blocks.
p336_281|there is no easy answer.
p336_282|i watch the other visitors.
p336_283|awareness in europe of scotland is high.
p336_284|i am not a liar.
p336_285|the cause remained a mystery last night.
p336_286|he had no problem with alcohol.
p336_287|i had no experience at all.
p336_288|yet he remains confident enough.
p336_289|it has become very confused.
p336_290|fame and money followed.
p336_291|it's a national sport.
p336_292|i just made it.
p336_293|there was no secrecy.
p336_294|a wide range of restrictions are in place.
p336_295|even then it might be difficult.
p336_296|i can't believe we didn't win that game.
p336_297|last night the extent of the damage was emerging.
p336_299|relief was beyond belief.
p336_300|beyond that would have been outrageous.
p336_301|it was complete nonsense.
p336_302|i seem to keep this for the majors.
p336_303|it is three years.
p336_304|they are not always the same person.
p336_305|we meet again in berlin.
p336_306|this is a very special moment for me.
p336_307|it is a daunting task.
p336_308|well it did last time he was reminded.
p336_309|we have chosen for the patients.
p336_310|that was me today.
p336_311|that is when we are really effective.
p336_312|they just would not have run away.
p336_313|but this isn't a play about the troubles.
p336_314|this idea has been around for four years.
p336_315|but he made a mistake in picking it.
p336_316|this is an appealing record.
p336_317|they are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p336_318|only new zealand has seen a similar increase.
p336_319|this is a problem we have to tackle.
p336_320|yes it was uplifting.
p336_321|nobody should believe this story.
p336_322|no person has been charged.
p336_323|one paper was not returned.
p336_324|i don't want to do too much.
p336_325|we don't have money to get to town.
p336_326|we have great support.
p336_327|one would not want to go there anyway.
p336_328|and it's difficult to argue.
p336_329|we'll see what happens.
p336_330|that could be in place by next year.
p336_331|that's not part of the deal.
p336_332|there is a problem.
p336_333|he pretended not to care.
p336_334|they are very concerned and you can understand that.
p336_335|not because they want to sing about something.
p336_336|was it too obvious?
p336_337|wouldn't it be nice?
p336_338|i was in tears in the street.
p336_339|eriksson though was having none of it.
p336_340|it is a terrible thing to have happened.
p336_343|the work was suspended following the kidnap.
p336_344|fifteen minutes later they were found.
p336_345|that is why we are here.
p336_346|he wouldn't do it.
p336_347|she becomes a mother.
p336_348|he is very much respected within the group.
p336_349|people want to learn.
p336_350|bomber was not amused.
p336_351|i am not a happy man.
p336_352|but it was fun.
p336_353|sometimes you get them sometimes you don't.
p336_354|no decisions have been made in this respect.
p336_355|it's been such a waste of money.
p336_356|not so it transpires.
p336_357|things don't look too good at the moment.
p336_358|inside there is a kind of madness.
p336_359|i'd like to run.
p336_360|its future is no longer in question.
p336_361|but this relative success has not been easy.
p336_362|i am a player.
p336_363|i couldn't quite believe it and still can't.
p336_364|he was not alone.
p336_365|there was too much at stake.
p336_366|who wouldn't do it?
p336_368|he was taken to hospital but later died.
p336_369|eriksson would have approved.
p336_370|we are all in the frontline.
p336_371|it looked like a war zone.
p336_372|his behaviour today has been disgusting.
p336_373|further expansion is possible.
p336_374|tyson said he had made a mistake.
p336_375|i'm interested in all kinds of history.
p336_376|at this point we can only speculate.
p336_377|we know we have the quality.
p336_378|in fact he should never have been in the field.
p336_379|it may be the first of many.
p336_380|it runs in cycles.
p336_381|it is already making a difference.
p336_382|i spoke to him yesterday.
p336_383|we are looking very hard at ourselves.
p336_384|this is the stuff of live music.
p336_385|we were beaten by the better team today.
p336_386|taxes may need to rise.
p336_387|it's unusual to say the least.
p336_388|i was quietly confident about getting the win.
p336_389|i am not going to sit back.
p336_390|but this is even worse.
p336_391|it left me with a sadness.
p336_392|i was living with my mum.
p336_393|the truth is he probably doesn't.
p336_394|there were few surprises.
p336_395|he is a one off.
p336_396|and then he laughs.
p336_397|she is having an affair with his partner.
p336_398|he put a lot of effort into it.
p336_399|the pressure is enormous.
p336_400|i am not that sadistic.
p336_401|are you all right?
p336_402|we owe it to the public of strathclyde.
p336_403|i'm certainly thinking about retirement.
p336_404|but we say yes and we are the people.
p336_405|is it any good?
p336_406|the investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p336_407|it would be that absurd.
p336_408|as if he would.
p336_409|i just carry on with my work.
p336_410|she made no further comment.
p336_411|his attacker has been a rangers fan.
p336_412|he wants the festival to make a difference.
p336_413|he didn't know it was his audition but it was.
p336_415|the auction has seven days to run.
p336_416|it is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p336_417|they want to prove a point.
p336_418|it is my decision and my decision alone.
p336_419|would he ever go back to the beginning?
p336_420|what is going on?
p336_421|let that be their memorial.
p336_422|we thought we were looking in good shape.
p336_423|tonight is very special.
p336_424|this is a matter of life and death.
p339_001|please call stella.
p339_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p339_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a sack for her brother bob.
p339_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p339_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p339_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p339_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p339_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p339_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p339_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p339_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p339_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p339_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p339_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p339_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p339_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p339_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p339_018|aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p339_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p339_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p339_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p339_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p339_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p339_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p339_025|they missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p339_026|the pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p339_027|glasgow is far from overload.
p339_028|it's a big mystery.
p339_029|what is a house without it?
p339_030|it was really good in the first week.
p339_031|it's about the balance.
p339_032|like his acting it was an accident.
p339_033|it really has not been their season.
p339_034|i want somebody with something to prove.
p339_035|this would give scotland around eight members.
p339_036|there was a ban on reporting the trial.
p339_037|i don't think the action was a mistake.
p339_038|you go in there and do it.
p339_039|we were in italy suddenly we knew.
p339_040|what will happen to them today?
p339_041|i didn't expect to get one.
p339_042|it was electric amazing.
p339_043|i said to him.
p339_044|labour has been found out on public spending.
p339_045|he told a producer.
p339_046|that is not the place for her.
p339_047|the jury is still out on this one.
p339_048|we have to work together.
p339_049|i don't think that he won't be released.
p339_050|it is a hard act to follow the winning act.
p339_051|it means it is difficult.
p339_052|but they were true stories.
p339_053|i needed to get away.
p339_054|i will make that point tonight.
p339_055|tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339_056|there are two things we have to do.
p339_057|are they going to work together again?
p339_058|we need to do that every week.
p339_059|it gives us something to work on.
p339_060|but what did it matter?
p339_061|a government is a government is a government.
p339_062|hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339_063|i am not retaining him.
p339_064|the police are not the target.
p339_065|it has affected it obviously.
p339_066|but that title is a mistake.
p339_067|and he's not a bigot.
p339_068|but summer is spent.
p339_069|services are being expanded too.
p339_070|it has only been rumours.
p339_071|it is extremely fortunate.
p339_072|today is the first step in that process.
p339_073|several others were absent.
p339_074|it is surprising to come back this way.
p339_075|but there was no time for that.
p339_076|a review is under way.
p339_077|that should be fun.
p339_078|maybe he will act again.
p339_079|what we were doing.
p339_080|what is the barnett formula?
p339_081|it all happened so suddenly.
p339_082|i won't let that happen.
p339_083|or have they?
p339_084|there is no change in the strategy.
p339_085|i had a fortunate war.
p339_086|it will probably be my last too.
p339_087|i am not completely insane.
p339_088|we spoke about a few people.
p339_089|she had to learn a new discipline.
p339_090|in fact he took it very well.
p339_091|i decided to take my time.
p339_092|quite a lot of people know that actually.
p339_093|we did it in one take.
p339_094|he doesn't even know who he is.
p339_095|it is hard to understand.
p339_096|what will it be?
p339_097|the search is due to be completed today.
p339_098|this was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p339_099|what you sow you have to reap.
p339_100|he is a one off.
p339_101|six men will take the decision.
p339_102|to have mr clinton is quite an accolade.
p339_103|we should not be surprised at that.
p339_104|it was a disaster.
p339_105|we have been so lucky.
p339_107|it was a bit of a tightrope.
p339_108|i don't know what we're doing wrong.
p339_109|it was all over now.
p339_110|but it was only a matter of time.
p339_111|i always liked to get a laugh.
p339_112|i still hope to go.
p339_113|sometimes they come off.
p339_114|we're not that bad.
p339_115|today is a victory for the scottish parliament.
p339_116|i feel strongly about it.
p339_117|there are exciting days ahead.
p339_118|we have to put this behind us.
p339_119|i thought it was quite good.
p339_120|this is a disaster averted for scotland.
p339_121|we're very very happy.
p339_122|there could be a possible connection.
p339_123|but there was everything
p339_124|we are doing very well as we are.
p339_125|the scots are great.
p339_126|that imbalance was evident in their play.
p339_127|however the drama was not over.
p339_128|but it was not just the land.
p339_129|i don't think the referees are against us.
p339_130|it is too much for me.
p339_131|it succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p339_132|we are still waiting.
p339_133|it happened again yesterday.
p339_134|he will be a major challenger next year.
p339_135|that question was never asked.
p339_136|i am not inclined to believe it.
p339_137|it was on fire.
p339_138|i have fallen in love with the highlands.
p339_139|how can they tell?
p339_140|my ambition is to make the cut.
p339_141|it will be for the committee to decide.
p339_142|their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p339_143|rangers must be winners it says.
p339_144|he was part of the family.
p339_145|i certainly think it should be there.
p339_146|but it does not matter.
p339_147|hopefully we can put in a performance.
p339_148|sadly he has a point.
p339_149|it was so sad.
p339_150|mind you all was not lost.
p339_151|we were extremely lucky.
p339_152|it was an amazing time.
p339_153|in fact the reasons are simple.
p339_154|the hearing is expected to continue today.
p339_155|it is just a matter of time.
p339_156|this news is really depressing.
p339_157|i'm not fit for anything else.
p339_158|the day may come but not for a while.
p339_159|the enemy was time.
p339_160|he would have done the same to me.
p339_161|what were they told?
p339_162|more cases are expected.
p339_163|i believe the gap is nearly there.
p339_164|it would be very dangerous.
p339_165|how can they say that?
p339_166|my condition is not bad.
p339_167|tomorrow is a big day for scotland.
p339_168|i would like to make an impact of course.
p339_169|i am confident of the outcome this week.
p339_170|the goal is clear.
p339_171|just think about the lines.
p339_172|it all depends on the wind.
p339_173|i was very influenced by him.
p339_174|i'm so worried about the roads.
p339_175|this was much worse.
p339_176|this was certainly not about money.
p339_177|it is simple but profound.
p339_178|the funding is now there.
p339_179|he was convicted at glasgow sheriff court.
p339_180|a film is different from a book.
p339_181|within three days he was dead.
p339_182|you'll find out on saturday.
p339_183|did they give any good advice?
p339_184|we know that from recent experience.
p339_185|from day one we were a family.
p339_186|it separates the men from the boys.
p339_187|this could be wonderful.
p339_188|he loved it and so did they.
p339_189|the other was a football match.
p339_190|they have the players to do it.
p339_191|which is worse?
p339_192|he has made a step forward.
p339_193|that was very important.
p339_194|this will have to change.
p339_195|first the programme was unbalanced.
p339_196|it was a very strong metaphor.
p339_197|we are going to have a party.
p339_198|i have no problem with that.
p339_199|the parliament will make its own decisions.
p339_200|i'm very happy that it exploded.
p339_201|we're all paying for it.
p339_202|lester was like that.
p339_203|look at new labour it hasn't worked.
p339_204|that's a matter for them.
p339_205|we were never told it was already decided.
p339_206|it is part of our heritage.
p339_207|it is not a road of life.
p339_208|it is not as simple as that.
p339_209|everything in the symphony is there.
p339_210|find them somebody they deserve.
p339_211|it's a big challenge for the audience.
p339_212|if that's the case he will struggle.
p339_213|it has certainly paid off for him.
p339_214|we're not getting involved.
p339_215|the lottery has helped.
p339_216|they know the language.
p339_217|the acting left a lot to be desired.
p339_218|we shall be victorious.
p339_219|the quality of work is very impressive.
p339_220|however he added there were signs of progress.
p339_221|you cannot do that in a lobby.
p339_222|we will all suffer as a result.
p339_223|without doubt they can win the title.
p339_224|what's it about?
p339_225|we are looking to the future.
p339_226|the signs are positive.
p339_227|i called it right.
p339_228|i see it as my job.
p339_229|i have always believed in myself.
p339_230|it has to be put in context.
p339_231|i think we can get there.
p339_232|i think the scottish bid is very strong.
p339_233|no they have played well.
p339_234|the reaction of staff has been fantastic.
p339_235|the answer is obviously no.
p339_236|i'll take it as it comes.
p339_237|i think we're the better side.
p339_238|we act because we must.
p339_239|there are two mysteries.
p339_240|the teacher would have approved.
p339_241|are you going to win?
p339_242|we didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p339_243|i could have been killed on that day.
p339_244|they have to come up with a solution.
p339_245|it is very enjoyable.
p339_246|now that would impress the kids.
p339_247|did it work?
p339_248|but that is for another day.
p339_249|there is a great carry over value.
p339_250|it was not like that at all.
p339_251|police are appealing for witnesses.
p339_252|i was very surprised.
p339_253|we all knew they could do it.
p339_254|it's about taking risks.
p339_255|why is this?
p339_256|he is due in israel tomorrow.
p339_257|it was indeed a night to remember.
p339_258|there are not too many like him.
p339_259|the memory is there.
p339_260|it was an amazing experience.
p339_261|nobody has been put on trial.
p339_262|he will go on the bench.
p339_263|the police are hopeless.
p339_264|there are no plans to change this.
p339_265|we are deeply concerned at the announcement.
p339_266|a spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p339_267|that's the important thing.
p339_268|should he resign?
p339_269|they have to live with the risk.
p339_270|it is but that's not the point.
p339_271|it was my whole life.
p339_272|it was a classic.
p339_273|this week is a perfect example.
p339_274|however it is going to happen.
p339_275|this time it really could happen.
p339_276|that sort of thing is long gone.
p339_277|that includes the equipment?
p339_278|it does nothing for me.
p339_279|that has been lost.
p339_280|but that's another story.
p339_281|i think it has worked.
p339_282|no other family members could be contacted.
p339_283|there is nothing to be gained from that.
p339_284|we're very proud of him and his achievement.
p339_285|but do not rely on it.
p339_286|i made a mistake.
p339_287|what do you want.
p339_288|that prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p339_289|i think we could do well in europe.
p339_290|and yet there has been no great impact.
p339_291|was that not awful?
p339_292|yesterday was a statement of intent.
p339_293|i'm not there yet but it is close.
p339_294|but it will not work again.
p339_295|even then he wanted to deflect attention.
p339_296|i have nothing to say on that.
p339_297|the rest is his own.
p339_298|i have no worry about that.
p339_299|there has been a fair bit in between too.
p339_300|who was on the panel?
p339_301|it turned out to have been three hours.
p339_302|that is exactly right.
p339_303|that is not good for golf
p339_304|he had planned to sell it.
p339_305|we know the goals will come.
p339_306|but it did not last.
p339_307|they need to look after themselves.
p339_308|they will be stopped and they will be punished.
p339_309|she asked for the appointment with me.
p339_310|we have nothing to lose.
p339_311|the first time it was rejected.
p339_312|he did not report it.
p339_313|no one can take it in.
p339_314|they were following his orders.
p339_315|that is an entirely different discipline.
p339_316|it was an insult.
p339_317|yet there is hope.
p339_318|referees in scotland are very weak.
p339_319|it will not be easy for him.
p339_320|that was a fairy tale.
p339_321|i would love to do that.
p339_322|you'll have to wait and see.
p339_323|it wasn't the issue.
p339_324|the number never came.
p339_325|i really have to go now.
p339_326|we are going to listen to britain.
p339_327|there isn't much of a scene in austria.
p339_328|words are not enough.
p339_329|he is in charge on the pitch.
p339_330|we have expected it.
p339_331|mr blair was ready for him.
p339_332|well that was the plan.
p339_333|the problem is fairly serious.
p339_334|no decisions have been taken.
p339_335|we won't do that.
p339_336|it's the body that counts.
p339_337|sprinters are not fit.
p339_338|this has been coming for weeks and weeks.
p339_339|it's a double whammy.
p339_340|charges against the pair were found not proven.
p339_341|let's not make that mistake again.
p339_342|that's why he is the prime minister.
p339_343|only injury has prevented that happening before.
p339_344|they have to be dealt with.
p339_345|his manager blamed the referee.
p339_346|so what was he really doing?
p339_347|i don't want to go anywhere.
p339_348|how do we get a bigger stage?
p339_349|we're very close to being a good team.
p339_350|i thought their commitment was superb.
p339_351|that will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p339_352|my mind is the most important thing now.
p339_353|i had nothing to lose.
p339_354|this is a really serious issue.
p339_355|i thought to myself.
p339_356|could it be?
p339_357|we're talking to the us.
p339_358|thereafter they were again in control.
p339_359|it looks as though there is no chance.
p339_360|you have to keep the focus alive.
p339_361|it could have been a ceilidh.
p339_362|i cannot really commit.
p339_363|there are many questions to be answered.
p339_364|sadly so did a couple of errors.
p339_365|this is a new beginning.
p339_366|there are moments of honesty too.
p339_367|they will fight for everything.
p339_368|he is doing just that.
p339_369|the night is young.
p339_370|but there are signs of a revival.
p339_371|i thought it was a great game.
p339_372|just get on with it.
p339_373|germany also said it was unimpressed.
p339_374|it shows the government is listening.
p339_375|she's the runner she makes the decisions.
p339_376|they want it to work.
p339_377|this is a completely new experience for me.
p339_378|they still have a great sense of humour.
p339_379|it decided to blame the media.
p339_380|we have chosen for the patients.
p339_381|he was at the outset of his career.
p339_382|our position is quite clear.
p339_383|it could now be up to the courts.
p339_384|we can make a difference.
p339_385|this was not a contest.
p339_386|so far the weather has been very pleasant.
p339_387|breaching that condition was itself an offence.
p339_388|i cannot describe it.
p339_389|it is not designed to kill.
p339_390|he has run a hell of a race.
p339_391|we'll have to be satisfied with it.
p339_392|gordon brown did not inherit a mess.
p339_393|it is good football in scotland.
p339_394|there is no other option.
p339_395|you can feel the tension in the air.
p339_396|it is a technique.
p339_397|is it the shape of things to come?
p339_398|my body is exhausted.
p339_399|it is about more than scotland.
p339_400|it's not just going to be busy.
p339_401|she was on the edge of breaking point.
p339_402|the first appeared to be successful.
p339_403|she was so supportive.
p339_404|i'm delighted with our performance.
p339_405|we await a decision.
p339_406|it's a matter of balance.
p339_407|it is an investment in our product.
p339_408|everyone can have their opinion.
p339_409|what would you ask?
p339_410|we have got to deal with it.
p339_411|where do we spend it?
p339_412|i don't know how she does it.
p339_413|i saw it later in the news.
p339_414|now we must look to the future.
p339_415|i didn't play badly.
p339_416|we haven't come out of this very well.
p339_417|they are looking for partners.
p339_418|i thought they could have made the gesture.
p339_419|we should have been rewarded for producing.
p339_420|i am also delighted for all the players.
p339_421|he did very well but didn't win.
p339_422|there is no shortage of questions.
p339_423|couldn't see the point.
p339_424|which in effect it is.
p340_001|please call stella.
p340_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p340_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p340_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p340_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p340_006|when the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p340_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p340_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p340_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p340_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p340_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p340_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p340_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p340_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p340_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p340_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p340_017|others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
p340_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p340_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p340_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p340_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p340_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p340_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p340_025|it would be nice.
p340_026|we are not prepared to do that.
p340_027|we've just decided to do something about it.
p340_028|it's a horrific incident.
p340_029|but it's not just about that.
p340_030|we've not won anything yet.
p340_031|he was very close.
p340_032|but someone has to take them.
p340_033|we don't find any danger from them.
p340_034|do you think they would do any better?
p340_035|they were appalling disgraceful.
p340_036|who was that?
p340_037|there was only one problem the teacher was still there
p340_038|this is my personal assessment.
p340_039|it is a recipe for success.
p340_040|you've got to have everything inside with you.
p340_041|we didn't deserve to win.
p340_042|this is great news.
p340_043|we can hardly talk about it.
p340_044|that was a month ago.
p340_045|i have lost all confidence.
p340_046|it would be another reason to live.
p340_047|i felt under a lot of pressure.
p340_048|none of the pieces was commissioned.
p340_049|it is somewhere to be.
p340_050|but it was no problem.
p340_051|this has been a difficult time for me.
p340_052|these people are not big names.
p340_053|don't you believe it.
p340_054|i certainly think it's very short sighted.
p340_055|we did something about it.
p340_056|where is the money coming from?
p340_057|it needs a rethink.
p340_058|why does it work?
p340_059|he would have been wrong.
p340_060|he played really really well.
p340_061|he was right of course.
p340_062|it's there for people to look at.
p340_063|together we can make a difference.
p340_064|that however was the exception.
p340_065|this has been a long process.
p340_066|it's a lovely lovely film.
p340_067|it's probably just as well.
p340_068|it is time for the talking to stop.
p340_069|we were very close.
p340_070|if only it were so.
p340_071|they do not deliver.
p340_072|however that is just for starters.
p340_073|this can be extreme.
p340_074|i'm sure that they will learn.
p340_075|would she remember the music?
p340_076|there was still more disquiet in israel.
p340_077|two options are being proposed.
p340_078|mr masterton said he was very hopeful.
p340_079|he is now back in britain.
p340_080|there was no commission.
p340_081|there was a vacuum.
p340_082|it is time to be realistic.
p340_083|everyone in front of me was dead.
p340_084|willie deserved it for what he has achieved.
p340_085|it is a potential danger.
p340_086|i've thought a lot about the commonwealths.
p340_087|but we never wanted to do that here.
p340_088|there was no hint of scandal.
p340_089|the money will go straight to the headteacher.
p340_090|he said we're delighted by the vote.
p340_091|it could be to do with the location.
p340_092|this is a terrible tragedy.
p340_093|the teenager had been missing for six months.
p340_094|i'm delighted to be coming back home.
p340_095|he said he never saw it.
p340_096|it is a matter of clarity.
p340_097|you will never get a conviction.
p340_098|he did not have to stop and think.
p340_099|we deserved to win it.
p340_100|or did it?
p340_101|it's just not funny
p340_102|his own excitement is never difficult to detect.
p340_103|he almost admitted as much.
p340_104|so what is the problem?
p340_105|we believe it to be completely without merit.
p340_106|he didn't bother a soul.
p340_107|that was my first reaction.
p340_108|fishing is a declining industry.
p340_109|another man said it was horrible.
p340_110|that's the way it goes.
p340_111|but we still don't know.
p340_112|are there any he wants to play?
p340_113|the film is on a tightrope.
p340_114|it was a question of patience.
p340_115|i have never been in anything like that.
p340_116|i have done ever since it was published.
p340_117|we have got to the top.
p340_118|in fact they have the opposite effect.
p340_119|and it worked so we kept it.
p340_120|the king is delighted by the honour.
p340_121|johnsen is equally concerned.
p340_122|my body is clearly capable.
p340_123|yes we can beat them.
p340_124|she was not hard done by.
p340_125|they said they were only young men.
p340_126|we are in the end game.
p340_127|this is not the case.
p340_128|there may be some resistance.
p340_129|it is the same old story.
p340_130|you need that freedom in society.
p340_131|it is a strong case.
p340_132|who do you think will win?
p340_133|i certainly would not accept this decision.
p340_134|that was one very hard game.
p340_135|he said something in his work.
p340_136|i recommend a tour.
p340_137|this research is extremely promising.
p340_138|i was invited to work in germany.
p340_139|weather conditions were good he added.
p340_140|don't hold your breath.
p340_141|he was shaking like a leaf.
p340_142|i have a moral dilemma.
p340_143|it looks like a hit.
p340_144|how did he know?
p340_145|he will have to live with his words.
p340_146|openness is always the best way.
p340_147|it added to the spectacle.
p340_148|they are working very well.
p340_149|and he listens to his artists as well.
p340_150|he is advised that he has done so.
p340_151|annika is very very fit.
p340_152|this is not quite right.
p340_153|it really is tremendous.
p340_154|i've never regretted my decision.
p340_155|this is a recipe for disaster.
p340_156|the wind was coming from all directions.
p340_157|so we started building a home.
p340_158|he was as good as his word.
p340_159|it will not happen overnight.
p340_160|surely it can't get any worse.
p340_161|he has to learn.
p340_162|he too will return.
p340_163|what then is wrong?
p340_164|my brother is not like that.
p340_165|he was very fit.
p340_166|it was very exciting.
p340_167|it is clear that change is required.
p340_168|they did a very good job.
p340_169|it has been a waste of time.
p340_170|as far as we're concerned the matter is closed.
p340_171|he had no previous convictions.
p340_172|it is no more than a shell.
p340_173|and did they have sex?
p340_174|but he was a really nice man.
p340_175|it was very close.
p340_176|it should be scrapped.
p340_177|it gives us hope.
p340_178|we can't determine that clearly.
p340_179|they are just trying to cover up.
p340_180|are you the man from the herald?
p340_181|and that's it?
p340_182|i came here this week to work.
p340_183|we are really good friends.
p340_184|but that is not an issue for now.
p340_185|of course the ending was fantastic.
p340_186|i want to be frank.
p340_187|this was an option from the beginning.
p340_188|clearly he is keeping in touch.
p340_189|yet it seemed to work.
p340_190|i think it was just a tragic accident.
p340_191|we haven't been able to go and see.
p340_192|it works as well.
p340_193|i can't say anything.
p340_194|i would be interested in another attempt.
p340_195|however that is a sizeable if.
p340_196|there is no other way.
p340_197|this was all well and good.
p340_198|this is a disaster for us.
p340_199|what does that mean?
p340_200|this is your life.
p340_201|he has seen the past.
p340_202|he can be beaten.
p340_203|he had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
p340_204|why does he do it?
p340_205|that's my daughter acting.
p340_206|they are very clever and very dangerous.
p340_207|it wouldn't matter if he had.
p340_208|we lost out a little bit.
p340_209|hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p340_210|i had just taken it off.
p340_211|the family baton is handed on.
p340_212|we have to put pressure on rangers.
p340_213|it was properly reported to us.
p340_214|he was outstanding today the best player on the park.
p340_215|the seller was not revealed.
p340_216|everything happened so quickly.
p340_217|how can this be?
p340_218|i am feeling a bit better.
p340_219|everyone here is heartbroken.
p340_220|not so it seems.
p340_221|he was also a great man.
p340_222|we have no further comment to make.
p340_223|this produces exactly the opposite effect.
p340_224|our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p340_225|you have to keep it on the fairways.
p340_226|sub not used mccormick.
p340_227|so there we won.
p340_228|i don't like to fail.
p340_229|i really didn't think he would.
p340_230|he may have a long wait.
p340_231|they have already done that.
p340_232|later a very different story emerged.
p340_233|so it should be.
p340_234|they didn't find any substance.
p340_235|it's hard to say.
p340_236|her heart was not in it.
p340_237|after all he is the king of scotland.
p340_238|is there any prospect of this happening?
p340_239|they are now collapsing.
p340_240|he had been surprised by the local reaction.
p340_241|government funding is not a problem.
p340_242|i'm still an amateur in that sense.
p340_243|we just did not want to believe it.
p340_244|the medal itself is not that important.
p340_245|i should think so too.
p340_246|the time for change is now.
p340_247|they deserved to beat us in the replay.
p340_248|can they be serious?
p340_249|we've got to get this right.
p340_250|the film was great.
p340_251|i'm just enjoying every match.
p340_252|they set up to win the hole.
p340_253|i am not a liar.
p340_254|let's make this clear.
p340_255|we also hope to meet the men.
p340_256|it was quite simply delicious.
p340_257|i can't believe it happened.
p340_258|thankfully it was cleared up.
p340_259|the game will be at a football stadium.
p340_260|they were his words.
p340_261|shelter also supports the reform.
p340_262|the attack was totally out of the blue.
p340_263|people were very confused.
p340_264|we've had a lot of adjusting to do.
p340_265|i am very relieved.
p340_266|the people have been really friendly.
p340_267|it was bound to happen and it has happened.
p340_268|aberdeen were difficult to break down.
p340_269|that though is not true.
p340_270|i hope he comes back.
p340_271|they made up for it on saturday.
p340_272|that was our mission.
p340_273|i am delighted for them.
p340_274|the second half was a different affair.
p340_275|the scheme has been funded by the government.
p340_276|they might be surprised by the response.
p340_277|i've done it all.
p340_278|we have worked well with them for years.
p340_279|they've had a good start as well.
p340_280|the director's a genius.
p340_281|one thing is clear.
p340_282|we might never see him again.
p340_283|such as it is.
p340_284|the car was just there.
p340_285|they were very unfair to him.
p340_286|i have spoken to my brother.
p340_287|and that is very good indeed.
p340_288|we could have had no new money.
p340_289|it wasn't an easy decision.
p340_290|it wasn't really like that at all.
p340_291|what will happen to them now?
p340_292|it is set in paris.
p340_293|the dream is as hard as they come.
p340_294|we are not collecting.
p340_295|it shows the right amount of progress.
p340_296|i thought the dancing was over.
p340_297|i think they have got it completely right.
p340_298|this is excellent news for glasgow.
p340_299|he's already made history.
p340_300|police have appealed for witnesses.
p340_301|there is a lot of fear.
p340_302|they are not left wing.
p340_303|i've heard it all before.
p340_304|we are not there yet.
p340_305|we will not give up on the truth.
p340_306|sub not used mccall.
p340_307|now they had it.
p340_308|she died a few days later.
p340_309|what is their concern?
p340_310|the difference was amazing.
p340_311|that is why we are here.
p340_312|but it is historic.
p340_313|you have to feel for the guy.
p340_314|i have still to hear about that.
p340_315|i'm going to win the next two.
p340_316|you know it was good fun.
p340_317|they want that school.
p340_318|they have not changed at all.
p340_319|one is investment one is reform.
p340_320|the last few weeks have been really bad.
p340_321|structural changes will never be enough.
p340_322|i am extremely cautious.
p340_323|that was always the danger.
p340_324|will they fall in love?
p340_325|there was nothing sinister in that.
p340_326|but don't just take my word for it.
p340_327|is that what it's about?
p340_328|and the audience is a surprise.
p340_329|they worked on it for three hours.
p340_330|let's make him a show.
p340_331|i'd never heard anything like it before.
p340_332|people are using it in their daily lives.
p340_333|it seemed so personal.
p340_334|would that be for men and women?
p340_335|the government agreed to pay.
p340_336|i think we have got the balance right.
p340_337|it was a very terrible thing.
p340_338|let's not take too much for granted.
p340_339|it has been an extremely long haul.
p340_340|i'll need to discuss it with my family.
p340_341|she is deeply distressed.
p340_342|they should have listened to me.
p340_343|well there can be no complaints about this one.
p340_344|they said they would.
p340_345|when will this change?
p340_346|you know the score.
p340_347|it was like someone had died.
p340_348|i am an innocent man.
p340_349|the improvement today was fantastic.
p340_350|he has been under great pressure.
p340_351|i'm looking forward to coming home.
p340_352|she is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p340_353|our great depression is our lives.
p340_354|he was elected as a councillor last year.
p340_355|i just did not cope with the pressure.
p340_356|but he did not appear.
p340_357|so he was anxious to try something new.
p340_358|the time was right.
p340_359|it all happened so quickly.
p340_360|it is working well.
p340_361|they really want to do it.
p340_362|he said nothing of the sort.
p340_363|governments will have to respond.
p340_364|it simply doesn't happen.
p340_365|we wanted to do something different.
p340_366|the past is history not destiny.
p340_367|i love it here.
p340_368|things are on track.
p340_369|frankly it was disgusting.
p340_370|it is a tragedy for the area.
p340_371|he was not entirely correct.
p340_372|i'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
p340_373|war is not the action.
p340_374|there are not enough of them.
p340_375|it has been a frustrating one.
p340_376|sadly it took a tragedy to change things.
p340_377|but we wouldn't want them any other way.
p340_378|what's in a name?
p340_379|it feels like a winner already.
p340_380|they are expected to be released today.
p340_381|there was no question of him not impressing.
p340_382|we were all afraid.
p340_383|i hadn't had that before.
p340_384|we have a plan in place.
p340_385|that is to miss the point.
p340_386|it will be a new experience.
p340_387|i didn't see it.
p340_388|scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p340_389|it had to happen.
p340_390|it is a challenge for all of us.
p340_391|the children are fine.
p340_392|i don't believe in god.
p340_393|there's also the point.
p340_394|it's good to be back.
p340_395|it wasn't the second one.
p340_396|he got his degree.
p340_397|and rugby fans can help.
p340_398|detectives are still working on the case.
p340_399|i reported it but nothing was done.
p340_400|they were not defeated.
p340_401|there was much to be positive about.
p340_402|it wants them to go home.
p340_403|i had a ball today.
p340_404|yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
p340_405|he said no survivors had been found.
p340_406|it is the end of an era.
p340_407|we shall not do that.
p340_408|my daughter was really really innocent.
p340_409|it will not be easy.
p340_410|once again he refused.
p340_411|and it will be a challenge.
p340_412|and scotland is no different.
p340_413|the power of religion is so strong.
p340_414|it means a huge amount.
p340_415|there are two interests in this woodland.
p340_416|i was frustrated here.
p340_417|it is a good result.
p340_418|are you watching liverpool?
p340_419|i'll never think of myself as a star.
p340_420|it was one new year.
p340_421|we made a world record together.
p340_422|our policy is already working well.
p340_423|i believe we have a good chance.
p340_424|things were not easy from the outset.
p341_001|please call stella.
p341_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p341_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p341_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p341_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p341_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p341_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p341_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p341_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p341_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p341_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p341_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p341_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p341_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p341_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p341_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p341_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p341_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p341_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p341_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p341_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p341_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p341_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p341_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p341_025|this guy is never going to give up.
p341_026|that's interesting to me.
p341_027|i managed to take her completely by surprise.
p341_028|it is only one night after all.
p341_029|the injuries are not too serious.
p341_030|gilbert was not amused.
p341_031|i was left handed but it was just a matter of practice.
p341_032|it has moved on in the last week.
p341_033|everything was up for grabs.
p341_034|it's easy to see why.
p341_035|i am proud of moments like that.
p341_036|that was no surprise to me.
p341_037|this has been blown out of all proportion.
p341_038|there is no escape.
p341_039|it's wonderful to have won.
p341_040|nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p341_041|he was arrested but later released without charge.
p341_042|i fell into it by accident.
p341_043|ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p341_044|this is a big advantage.
p341_045|her daughter is getting married.
p341_046|moray council could not be contacted last night.
p341_047|if you have to pay for treatment you pay for treatment.
p341_048|all the lads are totally focused on that.
p341_049|today is not about contracts.
p341_050|that says something for his strength of character.
p341_051|we are going for it.
p341_052|you see it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p341_053|it's to do with play.
p341_054|however the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p341_055|i've just got to do this.
p341_056|it's not of course a concert hall.
p341_057|so the process was refined.
p341_058|labour accused the tory leader of panicking.
p341_059|i know when my time is it doesn't bother me.
p341_060|i think it is a sensible change.
p341_061|sex is fun?
p341_062|they were not doing it too well either.
p341_063|he added it's not a racial problem.
p341_064|this is the crossroads.
p341_065|he had played well in that central role.
p341_066|he is pretty upset.
p341_067|and who would argue with that?
p341_068|where is the human rights?
p341_069|we must put a marker down.
p341_070|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p341_071|now just two games into the season he has gone.
p341_072|it is time to give her a rest.
p341_073|they had had time for little else.
p341_074|the feeling is awesome.
p341_075|we have reports of this throughout scotland.
p341_076|but there was a shift.
p341_077|the settlement could run to millions.
p341_078|it does not stop at the border.
p341_079|we've always had three options and none of them are perfect.
p341_080|he released a half dozen solo albums.
p341_081|robert is a special talent.
p341_082|john reid the northern ireland secretary yesterday appealed for restraint.
p341_083|in the meantime he added prevention was the key.
p341_084|they are going to carry it through.
p341_085|she added it is a huge problem.
p341_086|you can't keep them separate.
p341_087|the composer therefore believes he can do it.
p341_088|i still feel like a wee boy.
p341_089|he will be sentenced tomorrow by lord dawson.
p341_090|the feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p341_091|it had a gigantic effect.
p341_092|israel has done very little until now.
p341_093|debate was impassioned and furious.
p341_094|we are losing this war.
p341_095|it's a difficult one to play.
p341_096|the death rates are still as high.
p341_097|we are seeing a government in a hurry.
p341_098|it is a great honour and a privilege.
p341_099|we certainly will need to watch him.
p341_100|i don't think it could be clearer.
p341_102|he put some colour into scottish history.
p341_103|people buy everything with cash.
p341_104|we are trying to establish a date.
p341_105|he is a law unto himself.
p341_106|the website is now being amended.
p341_107|there was great support all round the route.
p341_108|i was a bit nervous.
p341_109|it was a bit of a struggle today.
p341_110|it was love of helen and the children.
p341_111|if you could have dinner with anyone who would it be?
p341_112|i love this tournament.
p341_113|this is thought to mean sometime next week.
p341_114|he had a heart problem.
p341_115|the breakdown was much later in her life.
p341_116|i tried to be cautious but it's hard in that role.
p341_117|both managements are very supportive.
p341_118|whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p341_119|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p341_120|the choice is strictly personal.
p341_121|we are going to go about our lives.
p341_122|he had other things on his mind.
p341_123|the lady is right.
p341_124|i hadn't seen them in eight years.
p341_125|don hutchison too is a threat.
p341_126|the next few months will tell.
p341_127|i'm so proud of my team.
p341_128|it is crucial for both teams.
p341_129|it ended as it began in confusion.
p341_130|i am now just a bit uneasy.
p341_131|you can see their point.
p341_132|council officials are involved along with the transport industry.
p341_133|there was no hint of bravado.
p341_134|however in scotland this figure was four weeks.
p341_135|yet he chose to do something different.
p341_136|he was happy the bbc was happy the listeners were happy.
p341_137|at this stage we think the air campaign is enough.
p341_138|there were no casualties.
p341_139|the case will now go to appeal.
p341_140|they really did a great job.
p341_141|a teacher is really about unity.
p341_142|they are still going to be impulsive.
p341_143|i love you so very much.
p341_144|he is a very nice man.
p341_145|the road was closed for several hours.
p341_146|their condition was described as stable.
p341_147|there's a good chance of seeing something.
p341_148|in time may prove a worthy successor to billy dodds.
p341_149|i had a tie in my hand.
p341_150|surrey police said no body had been found.
p341_151|sean connery did not disappoint.
p341_152|such a city does not exist.
p341_153|my aim is a top six finish.
p341_154|he came in an army uniform.
p341_155|we would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p341_156|it was to no avail.
p341_157|committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p341_158|but my heart is in athletics.
p341_159|that is in the very nature of farming.
p341_160|you shouldn't have a stoppage in november.
p341_161|these matters are now behind us.
p341_162|i'm working on that.
p341_163|i love the tradition of vaudeville.
p341_164|it was then into overtime.
p341_165|most of the public are behind me.
p341_166|the first eviction takes place on sunday.
p341_167|it really is a gift to the world.
p341_168|look at his last couple of records.
p341_169|i am still very much a director.
p341_170|we must not give in to bastards.
p341_171|she may even appear in some more films.
p341_172|in some cases the nation should be grateful.
p341_173|my house was shaking at the time.
p341_174|they will know they deserve to be there.
p341_175|of course he is.
p341_176|this is a very positive step forward.
p341_177|this is a huge confidence boost.
p341_178|they recorded their debut album in new york.
p341_179|and does it?
p341_180|the crackdown is launched today by the government.
p341_181|that's how it worked in bosnia.
p341_182|nobody ever knew it had happened.
p341_183|she is a very lucky lady.
p341_184|it's the whole season.
p341_185|we've been there for seven years.
p341_186|promises were not kept.
p341_187|his signature is his handwriting.
p341_188|he admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p341_189|i've already done that.
p341_190|we are on the path of change.
p341_191|you can feel at home in china.
p341_192|who is he?
p341_193|it has to be a long term commitment.
p341_194|no such remedy has ever been pursued.
p341_195|felt good about it.
p341_196|it also highlighted some local hero districts.
p341_197|the project is entitled the composer in scotland.
p341_198|why does she suddenly win everything now?
p341_199|what's the big idea?
p341_200|one season they might do well.
p341_201|it's fun and challenging but it is not easy.
p341_202|now it is official barry ferguson is staying with rangers.
p341_203|their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p341_204|it's up to their parents to choose.
p341_205|i feel privileged to be here.
p341_206|if they don't they might well decide not to play.
p341_207|she told me to apply for the crest.
p341_208|too much has already been said.
p341_209|john reid the scottish secretary also welcomed the news.
p341_210|he explained to his audience.
p341_211|i think the government should pay for that.
p341_212|i asked why he had come.
p341_213|he was a soldier.
p341_214|the budget was too low for that.
p341_215|all inquiries should be made to the police.
p341_216|it didn't get any better.
p341_217|i'm a bit annoyed.
p341_218|he doesn't like the labour party.
p341_219|i am totally devoted to this job.
p341_220|i just could not cope.
p341_221|he asked me in a tolerance zone.
p341_222|it is all one sided.
p341_223|i've been thinking about it for a year.
p341_224|scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p341_225|here are some possible solutions.
p341_226|that's the day job.
p341_227|glasgow is going to be open for business.
p341_228|it was a thoroughly modern affair.
p341_229|i'm not saying he is finished.
p341_230|that probably wouldn't happen at liverpool.
p341_231|he is well respected by his colleagues.
p341_232|it is anything but erotic but that is probably the point.
p341_233|usually you should leave it alone in the box.
p341_234|i would have dropped out otherwise.
p341_236|nato would ensure they could return home he said.
p341_237|mrs anderson said this one was different.
p341_238|we believe we have a strong case.
p341_239|i lost it at the final whistle.
p341_240|bill is a mentor.
p341_241|they have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p341_242|i think he has undergone a sea change.
p341_243|one must hope not
p341_244|it was a big day.
p341_245|what makes a house a home?
p341_246|i think however he was having a fit
p341_247|i live on the streets of glasgow.
p341_248|i will not be pressured.
p341_249|it doesn't make sense.
p341_250|i'll go back home and see my family.
p341_251|he admitted the asylum system was not working.
p341_252|have we not had the rainy season already?
p341_253|i have heard the stories from scotland.
p341_254|sub not used mckay.
p341_255|do not listen to them.
p341_256|mind you who wouldn't?
p341_257|that might happen in pakistan but in britain?
p341_258|he loves the big occasions.
p341_259|our system is archaic.
p341_260|it was a tactical change.
p341_261|that's what it's all about isn't it?
p341_262|when people talk about the beach boys and brian wilson.
p341_263|this time there were no such rewards.
p341_264|he said mr holland was a disgrace.
p341_265|i gave him a way out and he took it.
p341_266|before he left the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p341_267|she became very good at it.
p341_268|we don't have the credible evidence.
p341_269|it's one up to the scots.
p341_270|i'm just doing artwork.
p341_271|and we still have to pay his salary.
p341_272|also he was flawed.
p341_273|having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p341_274|so there's a double whammy.
p341_275|i didn't have a trio.
p341_276|their three other children had died as infants.
p341_277|that is a mark of what you are.
p341_278|his wife margaret was not in court.
p341_279|is it the players or is it the coaches?
p341_280|i hope my successor will do the same.
p341_281|the manager knew me very well.
p341_282|i have been totally taken aback by this.
p341_283|are you in this movie?
p341_284|we've got a full house tonight.
p341_285|if they don't they won't get what they want.
p341_286|the fans will support us.
p341_287|make sure you see it.
p341_288|it has however been a long time coming.
p341_289|we are aware of the two incidents.
p341_290|we also hope to meet the ulster unionists.
p341_291|it was just one of those things.
p341_292|the whole team was rubbish.
p341_293|now we need to keep our heads up.
p341_294|you've got it coming kabul.
p341_295|they must act now to tighten the rules.
p341_296|they too refused to come out and talk.
p341_297|but mainly it is up to ourselves.
p341_298|it's the curse of our time irony.
p341_299|that was enough for the committee.
p341_300|it's a source of deep concern.
p341_301|eating was a nightmare and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p341_302|but it was for charity just a bit of fun.
p341_303|clearly the ira has got away with murder.
p341_304|it is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p341_305|however there are also many areas of agreement.
p341_306|last month he made his debut in japan.
p341_307|the dow jones is way up.
p341_308|we have to adapt to this level.
p341_309|they were the better side on the day.
p341_310|what are you going to do exactly?
p341_311|we have lost the round but not the fight.
p341_312|there is nothing like a fresh start.
p341_313|calderwood would agree with that.
p341_314|no one thought about this.
p341_315|we're all in a state of shock.
p341_316|i thought he was part of the camera.
p341_317|you will never forget the clutching horror.
p341_318|farmers have been an endangered species.
p341_319|this is very bad news.
p341_320|he was released in march this year.
p341_321|no one however was complacent about the size of the task.
p341_322|i stayed away from the defence.
p341_323|we do need to get the message across.
p341_324|instead she just went away.
p341_325|that did not go down well.
p341_326|the palace said the queen was deeply saddened.
p341_327|it was chaotic and frightening.
p341_328|it is a question of balance.
p341_329|soon the whole country will be level.
p341_330|and huge indeed it is.
p341_331|tax is a matter for national governments.
p341_332|i'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p341_333|lambert will be playing against belgium.
p341_334|for his opposite number this was just triumph.
p341_335|he said he needed no more evidence.
p341_336|people might not actually want the job.
p341_337|it is the logical extension of audio description.
p341_338|it broke up my marriage.
p341_339|they told us about it the next day.
p341_340|two years ago the commission did not want to get involved.
p341_341|if there is default.
p341_342|we are very nearly there.
p341_343|he also was in debt to drug dealers.
p341_344|we have to go for it.
p341_345|i'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
p341_346|barry will be able to handle this.
p341_347|this is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p341_348|the urgency is real.
p341_349|i've already got them in.
p341_350|he takes time out for everyone.
p341_351|the science is well known the solution is simple.
p341_352|they are just bewildered and very concerned.
p341_353|i can't stop people thinking.
p341_354|the workers said they were treated like animals.
p341_355|i have not been so angry for years.
p341_356|she had every right to read the warrant.
p341_357|this is normal for him now.
p341_358|nothing was going to go right.
p341_359|there is too much at stake for that.
p341_360|nobody ever gets to see them.
p341_361|that's an old idea.
p341_362|scotland is losing business.
p341_363|the place became a war zone.
p341_364|what's happening to her?
p341_365|it was to get even better for motherwell.
p341_366|both parties can win and scotland can win as a result.
p341_367|the surprise is its product is so poor.
p341_368|i don't have a new house.
p341_369|it's always nice to play on centre court.
p341_370|thus the story will continue to thrive.
p341_371|you are a liar.
p341_372|her advice for glasgow is just be visionary.
p341_373|he is very unlikely to feature against ireland.
p341_374|see it while you can.
p341_375|folk music is in her blood.
p341_376|and we all understand that.
p341_377|one policeman was killed.
p341_378|and it's not funny.
p341_379|i didn't do too badly myself.
p341_380|we cannot lose it.
p341_381|they have learned from that.
p341_382|we have been working together for some years.
p341_383|chris paterson is a class act.
p341_384|we only lost the third goal.
p341_385|and that's the question for the chamber.
p341_386|that gave us some confidence.
p341_387|no one has yet been charged.
p341_388|such people do not exist.
p341_389|is this new report the answer?
p341_390|then came the second round.
p341_391|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p341_392|there was someone on the floor.
p341_393|story time is over it's a war.
p341_394|maybe who knows?
p341_395|however this idea is never developed.
p341_396|but it is all by design.
p341_397|it was a sell out.
p341_398|we've still got a say in this.
p341_399|things are going very well.
p341_400|she can't say where she was what she did.
p341_401|i'll take what comes along.
p341_402|jack mcconnell is the obvious choice.
p341_403|she will just have wanted her baby.
p341_404|golf has lost a great character.
p341_405|you have to have some hope and faith.
p341_406|they hold on for many years.
p341_407|however the report was incorrect.
p341_408|women reported more depression than men.
p341_409|he needs to be.
p341_410|the euro is your money it is our money.
p343_001|please call stella.
p343_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p343_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p343_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p343_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p343_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p343_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p343_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p343_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p343_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p343_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p343_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p343_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p343_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p343_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p343_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p343_019|since the physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p343_020|many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p343_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p343_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p343_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p343_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p343_025|i've got a long way to go.
p343_026|i'll go to the races.
p343_027|we will be back next year.
p343_028|i was very very pleased with our display.
p343_029|it is a crucial award.
p343_030|people don't feel safe including me.
p343_031|survival is our aim.
p343_032|but it might have done.
p343_033|nor is it likely to do so.
p343_034|what can you do?
p343_035|i read it every year.
p343_036|i go in for the parts.
p343_037|it should be the reverse.
p343_038|we are a team of hard workers.
p343_039|it is up to ann.
p343_040|and you know something?
p343_041|we were with him the whole time.
p343_042|that was the theory anyway.
p343_043|we've all been here before.
p343_044|i had troubles with the producers.
p343_045|so it took me back to boarding school.
p343_046|he died the following year.
p343_047|that's what we're trying to achieve.
p343_048|he is trying really hard.
p343_049|i have no doubt about that.
p343_050|it is a beautiful country.
p343_051|i expect a rapid response.
p343_052|there was still more disquiet in israel.
p343_053|this was never a support group.
p343_054|i must take a seat.
p343_055|my mother is a widow.
p343_056|being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p343_057|thankfully there were no reports of anything serious.
p343_058|the matter will come up again.
p343_059|i don't believe in gesture politics.
p343_060|the decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343_061|he should be a great asset.
p343_062|but that's another story for another day.
p343_063|one thing is sure.
p343_064|he has really done well.
p343_065|i'm just delighted to take it.
p343_066|this happened on three days inside a week.
p343_067|funding needs to be long term.
p343_068|it's funny how it comes and goes.
p343_069|it was just awful.
p343_070|that is really all.
p343_071|we played too deeply.
p343_072|we could have got three medals.
p343_073|i am ready to go.
p343_074|we are still suffering from that.
p343_075|the script was funny.
p343_076|we are at the crossroads.
p343_077|i am about protecting the state pension.
p343_078|they were at school together.
p343_079|i am looking forward to getting home.
p343_080|painful but only because it's true.
p343_081|once they go away they won't come back.
p343_082|colonel about this committee that is coming.
p343_083|that was the easy election.
p343_084|i didn't understand it.
p343_085|we should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p343_086|both sides have been hit by injury.
p343_087|no one was listening.
p343_088|i will report in the spring.
p343_089|we did discuss the lockerbie issue.
p343_090|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p343_091|it's terrible that this is happening.
p343_092|he's got the same story.
p343_093|they were going through the motions but that's about all.
p343_094|it is par for the course of course.
p343_095|and so it goes on.
p343_096|the winner will be announced next month.
p343_097|what was this?
p343_098|i am not a fan of books.
p343_099|it may well have been.
p343_100|frankly the party was not being honest with itself.
p343_101|we can only go up.
p343_102|i am not a doctor.
p343_103|it is all in the mind.
p343_104|and we have beaten them before.
p343_105|many others are subjected to violence by men.
p343_106|actually it turned out to be the concerto.
p343_107|i am not a paedophile.
p343_108|i've got to get noticed
p343_109|not that it was needed.
p343_110|it's up to them to decide.
p343_111|but we can't have a casino.
p343_112|i would love to play in europe again.
p343_113|the odds are that it will.
p343_114|after this they were always in the driving seat.
p343_115|i had no intention of misleading anyone.
p343_116|but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p343_117|he also has property interests in the country.
p343_118|that is the position the mod has adopted.
p343_119|the hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p343_120|i cannot believe this decision.
p343_121|this decision is destroying my family.
p343_122|why is that?
p343_123|well the big day has arrived.
p343_124|we reckon we can do very well.
p343_125|but it's been kept to a minimum.
p343_126|it has been a great day.
p343_127|we are not with you.
p343_128|then came the crunch.
p343_129|if so they were wrong.
p343_130|it is open season on the old firm.
p343_131|the answer is maybe.
p343_132|the dictator of iraq is not disarming.
p343_133|the referee had a shocking game.
p343_134|i haven't been able to do it since.
p343_135|it's about doing things.
p343_136|for a few years we had good fun.
p343_137|all the pressure will be on him.
p343_139|this is the logic of punishment assaults.
p343_140|that was a good effort.
p343_141|we are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p343_142|he must not be removed from office.
p343_143|he had finally had enough.
p343_144|but not all were so defiant.
p343_145|we are not going to get carried away.
p343_146|i told that to the police.
p343_147|on the other hand the poster did not help.
p343_148|in the end we did not spend a penny on him.
p343_149|but when we do it it is great.
p343_150|i'm going to win the gold.
p343_151|he pleaded for caution.
p343_152|it always had to be about the gym.
p343_153|only one got through.
p343_154|it's like a garage.
p343_155|they've been wonderful to me.
p343_157|i can't believe the buzz.
p343_158|it is a traffic warden.
p343_159|when it comes down to it this is a job.
p343_160|it had been played at festivals.
p343_161|that never came to court as a charge.
p343_162|dancing was her life.
p343_163|the latter way is my way.
p343_164|staff have been informed.
p343_165|it is one of those things.
p343_166|his is a success story by any standard.
p343_167|are his works inside out?
p343_168|he can do no wrong.
p343_169|on reflection it was really quite exciting.
p343_170|do they have to create seven majors?
p343_171|it has been handled entirely properly.
p343_172|i shall be voting yes to support him.
p343_173|is something which we just don't do.
p343_174|that began as an accident.
p343_175|it is though the law is not clear cut.
p343_176|he will want to utilise the midfield.
p343_177|two others were also seriously injured.
p343_178|i am looking forward to this film.
p343_179|this has been very frustrating for him.
p343_180|the talking cannot go on too long.
p343_181|i've got a young family.
p343_182|i hope that that will be forthcoming.
p343_183|but experience is a wonderful thing.
p343_184|footage has been passed on to the police.
p343_185|of course there was still much to be done.
p343_186|if he does he has a real chance of gold.
p343_187|next league matches motherwell dundee united.
p343_188|it was good today.
p343_189|she really suffered for her art.
p343_190|i wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p343_191|that tells you something.
p343_192|it has been a magical moment.
p343_193|is that not uncanny?
p343_194|surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p343_195|the hotel was huge.
p343_196|these days are over.
p343_197|a handful of those restrictions are in scotland.
p343_198|well you can have a tree.
p343_199|or so it is hoped.
p343_201|he said to give a local injection.
p343_202|this is an internal matter.
p343_203|entries from the event are still being accepted.
p343_204|they made such decisions in london.
p343_205|that has proved to be a lasting lesson.
p343_206|i was influenced by all of these things.
p343_207|he is helping police with their inquiries.
p343_208|the judges will give a ruling next wednesday.
p343_209|children also died in britain.
p343_210|i did not understand the dynamics of scotland.
p343_211|we want to get there.
p343_213|his appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p343_214|he said he would appeal the sentences.
p343_215|the hearing was fair.
p343_216|he has the edge.
p343_217|this was not a summit about the euro.
p343_218|if he leaves the band is finished.
p343_219|he saw it all as a big game.
p343_220|i didn't actually work up a speech.
p343_221|here we have not had one hour.
p343_222|that was never their agenda.
p343_223|but he kept on repeating it.
p343_224|she is currently in foster care.
p343_225|that's the only thing that matters.
p343_226|they were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p343_227|the service will only survive with change.
p343_228|it is however an unlikely outcome.
p343_229|as it was a double it was pretty expensive.
p343_230|you have a very persuasive president.
p343_231|it's always the same isn't it?
p343_232|she has not returned to work.
p343_233|we could learn a lot from them.
p343_234|he is the saviour of south africa.
p343_235|the players are obviously keen to do well.
p343_236|men should avoid it like the plague.
p343_237|it's really good fun.
p343_238|our positions remains unchanged.
p343_239|we are expecting a big crowd.
p343_240|is a drug dealer?
p343_241|we did not complete the process.
p343_242|obviously people are worried in the west midlands.
p343_243|where are you taking her?
p343_244|the weather forecast isn't good.
p343_245|they have not been named.
p343_246|he died later in hospital.
p343_247|it is ambitious but it can be achieved.
p343_248|he had a great game.
p343_249|it's still got that at its heart.
p343_250|actually nothing much will change.
p343_251|we will turn the corner.
p343_252|of course it is a tough assignment.
p343_253|there were too many mistakes.
p343_254|he says it often enough.
p343_255|however my position remains the same.
p343_256|it was totally out of the blue.
p343_257|horses are not affected.
p343_258|it went on forever.
p343_259|i'm not going to change from it.
p343_260|and they are different.
p343_261|it would have been very easily done.
p343_262|he knows the course.
p343_263|that idea is rubbish.
p343_264|there is no room for error.
p343_265|worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p343_266|as indeed they would be.
p343_267|if he could have prevented it happening he would have.
p343_268|we are all suffering.
p343_269|people should make their own decisions.
p343_270|that is a question for the next manager.
p343_271|i knew people on that committee.
p343_273|again we were lucky.
p343_274|there was no argument.
p343_275|he certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p343_276|she is a valuable member of government.
p343_277|i just need a bit of luck.
p343_278|but it's not the end of scottish football.
p343_279|we are talking about one family.
p343_280|he is not a pathetic figure.
p343_281|the error appeared in a warrant.
p343_282|everything is so new.
p343_283|it may take time to get it back.
p343_284|would they work together again?
p343_285|i can feel the sound inside.
p343_286|the answer is yes.
p343_287|i believe in debate and dialogue.
p343_288|the second aspect was the fear of failure.
p343_289|that is a personal matter.
p343_290|the princess has had other health problems.
p343_291|i would rather say nothing at the moment.
p343_292|the clarity is vital.
p343_293|i could not sit in the stands.
p343_294|he had a decision to make.
p343_295|strikers like to go to the ground.
p343_296|it makes no influence on the public.
p343_297|it's ahead of labour.
p343_298|it's the whole package.
p343_299|i was totally wrong.
p343_300|this has got to stop.
p343_301|it was a matter of chance.
p343_302|there is no point of looking any further.
p343_303|it is a real concern.
p343_304|is it the flight?
p343_306|strictly speaking it shouldn't be like this.
p343_307|scotland doesn't even have a target.
p343_308|they really shouldn't have put it out.
p343_309|a compromise is essential.
p343_310|last night the company could not be contacted.
p343_311|they need to be involved.
p343_312|it was not a cover up.
p343_313|the children continue to talk to us.
p343_314|you know the sort of thing.
p343_315|i cannot say too much about them.
p343_316|she went home from school and never returned.
p343_317|i will work on her.
p343_318|we told them in august.
p343_319|it is not easy to live in russia.
p343_320|green is desperate to play on the open.
p343_321|what on earth is happening to rugby?
p343_322|it is now being examined.
p343_323|it is so out of character.
p343_324|otherwise we would all pay the price.
p343_325|our thoughts are with her.
p343_326|it is time he said.
p343_327|everyone believes in it.
p343_328|we must learn to finish.
p343_331|he was a one off.
p343_332|that should give me a chance.
p343_333|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p343_334|it is my last chance.
p343_335|we played them off the pitch.
p343_336|the service from the other players was super.
p343_337|that fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
p343_338|he didn't let me down.
p343_339|you have been warned.
p343_340|we're not comparing like with like.
p343_341|i started on fire a couple of times.
p343_342|the shadow chancellor is always on holiday.
p343_343|it wasn't good but we'll get better.
p343_344|they will be up for it for sure.
p343_345|so you let me know.
p343_346|he too was unlucky not to get a goal.
p343_347|that will just be the beginning.
p343_348|no one can say that about me.
p343_349|that had not happened on this occasion.
p343_350|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p343_351|as a nation we must become more active.
p343_352|at the moment michael is in a class of his own.
p343_353|it is safe in our hands.
p343_354|harry potter has lost his magic.
p343_355|we will need to look at that.
p343_356|it comes down to the police in england.
p343_357|tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p343_358|it is a gamble.
p343_359|i expected a victory the pain is enormous.
p343_360|the tribunal continues today.
p343_361|these things have not happened by accident.
p343_362|so far the scheme has not been used in scotland.
p343_363|sure that already happens in new zealand.
p343_364|there's a hint of classical.
p343_365|we had to take action to protect them.
p343_366|surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p343_367|in the end however it all came together.
p343_368|he is a visionary.
p343_369|the warning was lifted late last night.
p343_370|there is always the smell.
p343_371|i have to take some of the blame.
p343_372|and if he hasn't become a musician?
p343_374|he is lying to save his skin.
p343_375|you have to do your research.
p343_376|he really has everything including a beautiful swing.
p343_377|he took away my childhood.
p343_378|i have spoken to the skipper.
p343_379|the call was ignored.
p343_381|it has happened and that is the end of the story.
p343_382|we don't do this for everyone of course.
p343_383|and there is another problem.
p343_384|that is the theory.
p343_385|it almost certainly is.
p343_386|they will have five minutes to decide.
p343_387|because it's a secret.
p343_388|my wife and family are the support system.
p343_389|the body follows the mind.
p343_390|i've done nothing wrong and that's the truth.
p343_391|they are there to help us.
p343_392|it just isn't a defining issue for them.
p343_393|you take a risk.
p343_394|which he is too.
p343_395|each one is as good as the other.
p343_396|sub not used mcarthur.
p343_397|i have hardly any commitments.
p343_398|there is no formula.
p343_399|the role was a knockout but really difficult.
p343_400|i love the feel of the place.
p345_001|please call stella.
p345_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p345_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p345_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p345_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p345_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p345_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p345_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p345_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p345_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p345_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p345_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p345_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p345_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p345_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p345_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p345_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p345_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p345_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p345_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p345_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p345_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p345_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p345_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p345_025|this is a new era.
p345_026|i want to go home.
p345_027|all the people here are local.
p345_028|the racist abuse was terrible.
p345_029|what is the new religion?
p345_030|the farmer is called an idiot.
p345_031|it's an amazing landscape
p345_032|i am prepared to step down.
p345_033|it's a lot of pressure on me.
p345_034|we had to laugh.
p345_035|it is too pretty it is too small.
p345_036|we're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p345_037|i was completely knackered.
p345_038|i'd rather be singing verdi.
p345_039|a killer is also on the loose.
p345_040|rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p345_041|you've got to be vigilant.
p345_042|you can see how he made his money.
p345_043|however there were some alarming findings.
p345_044|who wants to be a millionaire?
p345_045|we would certainly consider the proposals.
p345_046|i haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345_047|his record with england was not good.
p345_048|the opposite is the case.
p345_049|who would be a referee?
p345_050|suddenly it was indeed a new ball game.
p345_051|it was time to act.
p345_052|it's a question of fashion.
p345_053|i could never be cool.
p345_054|we will be paying agency rates.
p345_055|others said he had gone too far.
p345_056|we expect them to deliver for us.
p345_057|he was between people and god.
p345_058|i've never seen anything like it.
p345_059|they were willing us to get a second.
p345_060|no casualties were reported.
p345_061|the classes are taking place.
p345_062|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p345_063|the sleeper was six hours late.
p345_064|there will be no threat to the game.
p345_065|it would be a last resort.
p345_066|that is part of athletics.
p345_067|who would have known.
p345_068|we were caught out.
p345_069|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p345_070|i haven't made any definite decisions.
p345_071|i had to lie.
p345_072|among them is his beloved teacher.
p345_073|everyone was writing me off.
p345_074|how do we get more people in?
p345_075|the defender made an impressive debut.
p345_076|but her parents will never see her again.
p345_077|saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p345_078|i have nothing to lose.
p345_079|he would have loved it.
p345_080|we should be capable of managing it though.
p345_081|it was that kind of afternoon.
p345_082|it is a freedom.
p345_083|what happens next?
p345_084|all our futures will already have been decided.
p345_085|i would have been shot dead in bed.
p345_086|he insisted that his staff were too.
p345_087|they should come clean.
p345_088|he was pronounced dead in hospital.
p345_089|i believe that so strongly.
p345_090|that though is an old story.
p345_091|inside the atmosphere was quiet.
p345_092|they don't work anymore anyway.
p345_093|it's about time something was done about equipment.
p345_094|it was a funny feeling.
p345_095|he was at it again yesterday.
p345_096|you can't go on forever.
p345_097|so far this season this approach is working.
p345_098|however his involvement was instant.
p345_099|it has to work.
p345_100|it was for me like a week in heaven.
p345_101|certainly there is much on the agenda.
p345_102|there's something about being cut off.
p345_103|this is his personal life.
p345_104|i asked for a picture and she said no problem.
p345_105|if not a deal could take many months.
p345_106|it's as eventful as it is momentous.
p345_107|i was going to help with the dinner.
p345_108|would you pay to come and see it?
p345_109|what are they like?
p345_110|i would probably have to agree with him.
p345_111|they were back in favour with the sac.
p345_112|he had a moustache.
p345_113|i have been thinking about that this week.
p345_114|let's get it on.
p345_115|together they will attempt to express the whole.
p345_116|everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p345_117|it is really good news.
p345_118|we just want a fair deal.
p345_119|i'll just have to live with that.
p345_120|neither of them was badly hurt.
p345_121|he is the acting and deputy first minister.
p345_122|we wanted it left for a wee while.
p345_123|at the moment the success in germany is good.
p345_124|it is sad and frustrating.
p345_125|our intentions are real.
p345_126|the tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p345_127|finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
p345_128|she has left the island.
p345_129|that will be the case on tuesday.
p345_130|as to rugby well no one knows.
p345_131|it certainly should not be used too often.
p345_132|the whole matter is done and dusted.
p345_133|i don't know where that one came from.
p345_134|the shooting created panic in the street.
p345_135|he would just say it was terrible.
p345_136|our destiny is in our own hands.
p345_137|that's not fair to the supporters.
p345_138|i was on my own.
p345_139|they were part of our own family.
p345_140|it doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
p345_141|i don't have any perspective on it.
p345_142|scotland has lost a great man.
p345_143|scotland is an increasing concern for young people.
p345_144|in fact they will not be disciplined.
p345_145|his name has not been released.
p345_146|for some it was more painful than others.
p345_147|it plainly does not work.
p345_148|his words were not audible.
p345_149|that's a huge amount.
p345_150|see the amazing arrogance of this they say.
p345_151|it was even worse than at home.
p345_152|i still think he will win.
p345_153|but they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p345_154|normally it would be four minutes.
p345_155|it may have been a cry for help.
p345_156|but the damage had been done.
p345_157|no you couldn't make it up.
p345_158|we are trying to clarify the issues.
p345_159|however he did not stay there very long.
p345_160|and so they have.
p345_161|i have a great respect for her.
p345_162|i suggest a new plan.
p345_163|it takes the biscuit.
p345_164|but perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p345_165|we don't have a solution to the problem.
p345_166|miller was every bit as happy.
p345_167|the result is utterly compelling.
p345_168|but it won't be the same.
p345_169|other forces were however at work.
p345_170|inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p345_171|it is a hobby for me.
p345_172|if only the acting profession was that simple.
p345_173|it was like a kick in the belly.
p345_174|bombing is the easy option.
p345_175|we should have gone solo.
p345_176|directing if you like.
p345_177|that will be the case.
p345_178|now it's all right.
p345_179|all will be revealed in due course.
p345_180|they have known the hard times.
p345_181|we don't know what happened.
p345_182|you cannot enter the clubhouse.
p345_183|they had seven children.
p345_184|that in itself is an erotic experience.
p345_185|death is outside the language.
p345_186|you have a plan?
p345_187|it's all too early.
p345_188|everything in the world was focused on london.
p345_189|we've seen that time and time again.
p345_190|i was never alone with her right?
p345_191|it's not only my respect for them.
p345_192|tonight's matches european championship.
p345_193|this is a very high price.
p345_194|that's when you hope to take advantage.
p345_195|i never want to have any children.
p345_196|business has never been so bad.
p345_197|there is no way to do this.
p345_198|edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p345_199|i know my sons.
p345_200|clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p345_201|it was too close to call.
p345_202|but who is the killer?
p345_203|no it's never been mentioned.
p345_204|things were so intense in the studio.
p345_205|the devil of course will be in the detail.
p345_206|then another one came.
p345_207|progress is being made but it is slow.
p345_208|everything has been destroyed.
p345_209|the lobby is not failing.
p345_210|but it is looking very positive.
p345_211|drugs are getting through.
p345_212|he would have come into the house.
p345_213|i want to put myself on discussion also.
p345_214|it happens in real life.
p345_215|at the time he was a living legend.
p345_216|and we will do it.
p345_217|it's a human tragedy.
p345_218|but we are losing that connection.
p345_219|i am going to fight to the end.
p345_220|either group is living in fantasy land.
p345_221|it's the right thing.
p345_222|that was a disgraceful performance.
p345_223|must have been at the bar.
p345_224|but this is just the start.
p345_225|i can't get away from it.
p345_226|i believe in the union.
p345_227|scotland has shown the way.
p345_228|but he is not hopeful.
p345_229|it will be all about the olympics.
p345_230|they are very frightened.
p345_231|we have all been there at some point.
p345_232|this is my homeland.
p345_233|the game was up.
p345_234|that is not an easy thing.
p345_235|another casualty yesterday was john prescott.
p345_236|i didn't know where they were.
p345_237|rangers are my life.
p345_238|lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p345_239|three weeks later he resigned.
p345_240|there are two options.
p345_241|i can't describe it.
p345_242|surely it should be the other way round.
p345_243|there is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p345_244|i get on him he gets on me.
p345_245|this is wonderful news.
p345_246|i am appalled by this news.
p345_247|no injuries were reported.
p345_248|it is not surprising but it is appaling.
p345_249|it is understood he had been stabbed.
p345_250|it's too much work.
p345_251|we were extremely arrogant.
p345_252|actually it's an amazing orchestra.
p345_253|the waiting game continues.
p345_254|hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p345_255|i don't think he was being very fair.
p345_256|you've got to fight to stay up.
p345_257|but the foundations have been laid.
p345_258|we're looking for unity in the council.
p345_259|the observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p345_260|what is so unusual about this case?
p345_261|fatherhood is important to tony blair.
p345_262|but this is different.
p345_263|i'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p345_264|it doesn't look good.
p345_265|that will not change.
p345_267|her presence was almost everywhere.
p345_268|asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p345_269|it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
p345_270|there is enormous interest in scotland the brand.
p345_271|they've been at it for five hours.
p345_272|this action could have been avoided.
p345_273|the distinction is also supported by doctors.
p345_274|and they still have the final to come.
p345_275|anyone else can apply.
p345_276|he looked like a schoolboy.
p345_277|it was like the old days.
p345_278|but that is about to change.
p345_279|the whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p345_280|we can build on that.
p345_281|it could be a danger.
p345_282|we are not going to be complacent.
p345_283|the only problem was they were on himself.
p345_284|his body was found in may.
p345_285|he's a joy to follow.
p345_286|why do you want to come to edinburgh?
p345_287|i'm sure you all can relate to that.
p345_288|my wife is coming over at the weekend.
p345_289|sure he is the best player in the world.
p345_290|it starts to get you down.
p345_291|i don't think we could have expected better.
p345_293|somebody has to speak up for common sense.
p345_294|but they miss the whole point.
p345_295|you have to count on other people.
p345_296|i said what was that about?
p345_297|immediate action must be taken.
p345_298|this could prove a problem.
p345_299|i was a local hero.
p345_300|he is an excellent defender strong and quick.
p345_301|it will be extremely difficult for him.
p345_302|it's a gigantic con.
p345_303|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p345_304|this club have been fair to me.
p345_305|i didn't know she could do that.
p345_306|what does she consider her greatest achievement?
p345_307|this is too much like scotland.
p345_308|i can't say anything about any figure.
p345_309|a counter reaction was.
p345_310|that goes back a long way.
p345_311|i wouldn't have had the abandon.
p345_312|she has fallen in love with scotland however.
p345_313|they were not missing much.
p345_314|it should not make the same mistake again.
p345_315|holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p345_316|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p345_317|it's always a dilemma.
p345_318|as far as scotland is concerned he should relax.
p345_319|is she in trouble?
p345_320|it is a symbolic concert.
p345_322|it is a very beautiful city.
p345_323|she added the sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p345_324|but could it afford to run it?
p345_325|i am very happy with him.
p345_326|i was waiting for that question.
p345_327|her body was found on monday morning.
p345_328|i am not against a further inquiry.
p345_329|his father said my son was lucky.
p345_330|who would have thought it?
p345_331|we will win the argument.
p345_332|five years later the deception continued.
p345_333|i might get an injury very easily.
p345_334|i feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p345_335|stock markets will be watching closely.
p345_336|i just want to do the good work.
p345_337|i'm very happy tonight.
p345_338|he was overwhelmed by the response.
p345_339|mr straw was home secretary at the time.
p345_340|now it was serious.
p345_341|this is his first movie.
p345_342|he is already in place.
p345_343|no one would believe him.
p345_344|we live in shorthand.
p345_345|but something has been lost in the translation.
p345_346|spent three months alone at sea.
p345_347|i made a big mistake.
p345_348|i just know it's a lot.
p345_349|i saw one body.
p345_350|i am very happy.
p345_351|there was no discussion about it.
p345_352|three hours later the man was free.
p345_353|it was a very big win for us.
p345_354|i've never felt affection for emu.
p345_355|everything is up for grabs.
p345_356|we had a good time.
p345_357|i was utterly hopeless at it it must be said.
p345_358|this was a good performance.
p345_359|however the snow was welcomed by some.
p345_360|it is not simple.
p345_361|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p345_362|our task is to complete the picture.
p345_363|it is a road of death.
p345_364|the government would be ready they said.
p345_365|her life is now back on track.
p345_366|i said at the time it was wrong.
p345_367|by now he was very ill with cancer.
p345_368|anything that was going really.
p345_369|he will take it in his stride.
p345_370|i don't believe a word of it.
p345_371|i couldn't put my finger on it.
p345_372|people can really get themselves in a mess.
p345_373|the winner will be announced in december.
p345_374|this is bound to happen.
p345_375|suddenly there was an audience.
p345_376|it has not yet opened to pupils.
p345_377|the letters are going out today.
p345_378|i did not name it.
p345_379|and therein lies the problem.
p345_380|i also thought this is a feature film.
p345_381|mcmaster had already seen the first part.
p345_382|or is it?
p345_383|is he going to look after them?
p345_384|they are appealing for witnesses.
p345_385|this is the last chance and everyone knows it.
p345_386|it is quite simple.
p345_389|it does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p345_390|his instructions were clear.
p345_391|there is ample evidence.
p345_392|it was a game we had to win.
p345_393|i've never had problems with any football managers.
p345_394|to begin with it looks good.
p345_395|i won't go back to holland.
p345_396|there is still a long way to go.
p345_397|almost overnight he found his voice.
p345_398|this was a unique election.
p345_399|it was still there last night.
p345_400|in his absence the council adopted the change.
p347_001|please call stella.
p347_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p347_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p347_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p347_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p347_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p347_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p347_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p347_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p347_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p347_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p347_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p347_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p347_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p347_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p347_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p347_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p347_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p347_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p347_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p347_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p347_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p347_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p347_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p347_025|a crucial moment has arrived.
p347_026|we still have a long long way to go.
p347_027|some will be deployed on submarines.
p347_028|there are moments of silence.
p347_029|so now this series has had its day.
p347_030|gaelic provision continued to be good.
p347_031|bobby robson called him a genius.
p347_032|it's a policy which has worked for us.
p347_033|locally too the mp is under fire.
p347_034|that didn't happen for two reasons.
p347_035|his views are hardly surprising.
p347_036|it is time for a new approach.
p347_037|and look at the leading conductors he says.
p347_038|we have nothing to say about that.
p347_039|we've tried every other way.
p347_040|i'll have to go out and impress.
p347_041|slowly however a picture is emerging in scotland.
p347_043|he had a really frustrating time last year.
p347_044|it does make a big difference.
p347_045|how many cases have there been?
p347_046|peter of course refuses to conform.
p347_047|you can't give in to the vandals.
p347_048|the old firm are going nowhere.
p347_049|everything was an effort.
p347_050|and does it even matter?
p347_051|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p347_052|my parents are exhausted.
p347_053|no it wasn't supposed to do that officials admitted.
p347_054|alright it was a defeat but it felt like a victory.
p347_055|if he does not leave he will be shot.
p347_056|my thoughts are with their families.
p347_057|it will come up here.
p347_058|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p347_059|yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p347_060|it is a very special city.
p347_061|this is only the start of my season.
p347_062|the message is just not getting through.
p347_063|it sounded awfully like panic.
p347_064|i've taken to the hills.
p347_065|this is a big big win.
p347_066|the crowd was awesome.
p347_067|my game is in pretty good shape.
p347_068|we were given a break.
p347_069|he already had had complaints.
p347_070|how come it is so often unnoticed?
p347_071|i wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p347_072|thankfully mr campbell was able to help.
p347_073|they had not been handcuffed.
p347_074|i think we will join the single currency.
p347_075|then it was the turn of the carnival.
p347_076|you have to rely on each other.
p347_077|one thing is certain.
p347_078|we cannot ask for them back.
p347_079|it's a delightful idea but a distancing one.
p347_080|no one said anything to me.
p347_081|all of us do.
p347_082|that is in the public domain.
p347_083|the hague is too good for him.
p347_084|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p347_085|in just a fortnight however everything has changed.
p347_086|it's a true story.
p347_087|this is a club on the rise.
p347_088|john prescott is john prescott as the prime minister would say.
p347_089|theatre is not a museum.
p347_090|it is a hangover effect.
p347_091|this is my life.
p347_092|subs not used mcculloch.
p347_093|whatever the final decision one thing is certain.
p347_094|the thing is to recognise that chance.
p347_095|we gave them the goal.
p347_096|they don't take you to mass graves.
p347_097|there was no option.
p347_098|what's it got to do with art?
p347_099|could they perhaps be related?
p347_100|but who shot the president?
p347_101|we do not get that impression now.
p347_102|i'm looking forward to that.
p347_103|it was not a beautiful game was it?
p347_104|safety was also an issue.
p347_105|that's why he visited.
p347_106|i know a lot of people who don't.
p347_107|there was nobody on the roof.
p347_108|clark is back on top form.
p347_109|he served in the gulf the falklands and northern ireland.
p347_110|it needs somebody to give way.
p347_111|we have to reinforce the pressure on iraq.
p347_112|it is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p347_113|they are all arabs.
p347_114|the days of empty promises are over.
p347_115|henry was strong and talented.
p347_116|that is our unfinished business.
p347_117|within six minutes they were two goals down.
p347_118|faces from the eighties.
p347_119|why did it take a concerted campaign?
p347_120|martin johnson the england captain was back and commanding.
p347_121|whatever he does however it will be decisive.
p347_122|you can cope with it.
p347_123|it is an interesting title believing in britain.
p347_124|they will do their own thing.
p347_125|both these events occurred on wednesday night.
p347_126|we are in the business of selling tickets.
p347_127|it is just part of modern day life.
p347_128|a young briton had a lucky escape.
p347_129|our idea is to make it entirely irish.
p347_130|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p347_131|you thought it was a headache.
p347_132|all the people thought that we would die.
p347_133|it is never an easy game.
p347_134|this year it will be billy crystal.
p347_135|no one else is like michael jackson.
p347_136|i don't want to come down.
p347_137|however it's good to turn the page.
p347_138|i thought it was quite good.
p347_139|he had reason to be pleased.
p347_140|it was important to win the singles.
p347_141|that is impressive by any standards.
p347_142|i felt we needed to bring that in.
p347_143|there is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p347_144|i'm thinking what would be easier?
p347_145|that alibi is now gone.
p347_146|but the cost to his health was enormous.
p347_147|too many factors are now working against him.
p347_148|is the war over?
p347_149|you do have a way out.
p347_150|it is simple really.
p347_151|i just wasn't very good.
p347_152|pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p347_153|but he is not using them.
p347_154|christians in pakistan are terrified.
p347_155|i certainly believe we can do it.
p347_156|they've got a sort of unwritten contract.
p347_157|it was a breathtaking moment.
p347_158|that's been our position all along.
p347_159|i was in jail for five years.
p347_160|we have not had a formal request.
p347_161|i never had a childhood.
p347_162|its effect on humans is not yet known.
p347_163|we offered something different.
p347_164|we were very much a happy family.
p347_165|they won the trophy in the hoops.
p347_166|it is true but it is only part of the issue.
p347_167|it's going to be epic.
p347_168|not everyone however was pleased with the proposed changes.
p347_169|it was large enough to fit the wall.
p347_170|she could easily have been killed.
p347_171|british officials said they could not say.
p347_172|yesterday one from aberdeen was postponed.
p347_173|i never found my rhythm.
p347_174|i didn't mean to kill her.
p347_175|it is a job creation scheme.
p347_176|in less than two months the women have achieved a lot.
p347_177|we might be back next year.
p347_178|it's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p347_179|the same goes for personnel.
p347_180|saddam hussein has made the case against himself.
p347_181|in fact they should have scored three times.
p347_182|moving from manchester to london was upheaval enough.
p347_183|this area is perfect for children.
p347_184|the firm was down and almost out.
p347_185|i was chosen to do this.
p347_186|i learned a lot from that.
p347_187|i think we're very different.
p347_188|the boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p347_189|there was an element of jealousy.
p347_190|glasgow then took control.
p347_191|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p347_192|my ambitions are still with football.
p347_193|that certainly brought me back down to earth.
p347_194|glasgow deserved their win but we made them look good.
p347_195|domestic disturbance is currently on general release.
p347_196|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p347_197|because of this he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p347_198|our approach will be different.
p347_199|it's not right of labour.
p347_200|it is legally binding.
p347_201|we went straight into the bedroom.
p347_202|before the games it was pretty open.
p347_203|but you can go beyond that condition.
p347_204|he is only now regaining his confidence.
p347_205|singing has gone out of fashion.
p347_206|he was convicted at glasgow sheriff court.
p347_207|early warnings could help but it's a scary thought.
p347_208|who can tell?
p347_209|however the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p347_210|they might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p347_211|my attitude is exactly the same as before.
p347_212|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p347_213|or some thought that they have.
p347_214|he has lost confidence and weight.
p347_215|that was moving the goalposts.
p347_216|this process of attrition is expected to continue.
p347_217|a treasury spokesman derided the tory charge.
p347_218|you'll get on like a house on fire.
p347_219|two and a half million people have died.
p347_220|it could not be too high.
p347_221|or so it would appear.
p347_222|do not forget about monaco.
p347_223|i hope they understand that.
p347_224|you can never tell.
p347_225|but annika is just amazing.
p347_226|our job is to change that.
p347_227|she will also get a pay rise.
p347_228|the damage has been done.
p347_229|it is time for a more honest approach.
p347_230|that's the national grid.
p347_231|that is very very bad news for our nation.
p347_232|nobody can change it overnight but you can make a start.
p347_233|it is a big time for me.
p347_234|there were two things going on at once.
p347_235|he wouldn't allow that to happen.
p347_236|it is a cause for concern.
p347_237|stalkers are capable of killing.
p347_238|that is the key message.
p347_239|it ignores the future.
p347_240|this is the subway.
p347_241|altman has every right to be bitter.
p347_242|what's the rush?
p347_243|glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p347_244|he's in with the furniture.
p347_245|do not go into government buildings.
p347_246|there is only one caveat.
p347_247|we are still getting signals.
p347_248|what's it got to do with them anyway?
p347_249|i am happy to play for aberdeen.
p347_250|nothing is being offered in exchange.
p347_251|everyone can be bought.
p347_252|there are a few changes.
p347_253|you're not going to get hurt.
p347_254|the arrow was aimed at the heart.
p347_255|the new deal will constantly be improved.
p347_256|the headless man has finally developed a face.
p347_257|i heard some of his remarks.
p347_258|i am a little bit tired.
p347_259|staff should be paid for what they produce.
p347_260|i was just overwhelmed.
p347_261|it had been in place since last july.
p347_262|i have just got to get back.
p347_263|in that case we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p347_264|players want to know what is on offer.
p347_265|well when did he ever refuse?
p347_266|we will have to see but it makes you think.
p347_267|i'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p347_268|the singer's condition was not specified.
p347_269|how much of a cop out is that?
p347_270|the whole region is in shock.
p347_271|it was a journey into a new life.
p347_272|it will be the final push.
p347_273|life as many people know it in other words.
p347_274|you were the kidnappers.
p347_275|it is a very interesting subject.
p347_276|arguably they have already done it.
p347_277|she had been in germany for medical treatment.
p347_278|raymond was always on the outside.
p347_279|the women were on their way home yesterday.
p347_280|i could feel the blood on my face.
p347_281|i am a committed european.
p347_282|there are no plans to change this.
p347_283|the real ira was blamed for the blast.
p347_284|it's in the eyes.
p347_285|working with him is like working with myself.
p347_286|it is just too long since the war.
p347_287|she didn't tell us anything new.
p347_288|i mean it happens.
p347_289|my wife is totally behind me on this.
p347_290|debbie harry was cool.
p347_291|insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p347_292|receiving this medal is an honour.
p347_293|sub not used mcculloch.
p347_294|six months later they returned to scotland.
p347_295|it is typical of me.
p347_296|raised the way you want it.
p347_297|however consumers may take a different view.
p347_298|i know you went back this morning.
p347_299|they played it like a cup final.
p347_300|this has a number of benefits.
p347_301|i will carry on.
p347_302|i think it is a great shame.
p347_303|a review of the decision is being sought.
p347_304|it will be about commitment not compliance.
p347_305|the chief constable is right.
p347_306|and we were right.
p347_307|that is where the club has gone wrong.
p347_308|a hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p347_309|surely it can do better than that?
p347_310|it's my favourite place to hang out.
p347_311|i think that could work to our advantage.
p347_312|i like an idiot agreed.
p347_313|councillor gordon has refused to stand down.
p347_314|he will make an excellent chief inspector.
p347_315|we hope this scheme will change that.
p347_316|i cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p347_317|the red card was okay.
p347_318|the government has to grasp the nettle.
p347_319|although it was expected everyone is very very angry.
p347_320|i would welcome a proper public discussion on this issue.
p347_321|however the referee was not in the giving vein.
p347_322|i was doing well at the hustings.
p347_323|but even without either glasgow will be outstanding.
p347_324|this is my music.
p347_325|i haven't won the world title.
p347_326|after his birthday scott was very upset.
p347_327|it's fantastic to have finally won.
p347_328|but she's also beautiful behind the face.
p347_329|there is no date on this document.
p347_330|and now he tells us.
p347_331|i am not changing my event.
p347_332|i know nothing about that.
p347_333|ferguson did not hesitate.
p347_334|that is as it may be.
p347_335|they did too but it didn't matter by then.
p347_336|this is the start of a new campaign.
p347_337|eleven events are required.
p347_338|it should have a health warning it is addictive.
p347_339|you encourage them you can do it.
p347_340|the winner will be announced by early summer.
p347_341|i always said no.
p347_342|britain is a peaceful nation.
p347_343|government must recognise the problems of aberdeen.
p347_344|it is very much a matter for them.
p347_345|our future was his future.
p347_346|his name is michael owen.
p347_347|it has made a difference.
p347_348|he's got a great chance of making it.
p347_349|tartan day is not a scottish event.
p347_350|surely if anything it would be the other way round.
p347_351|so now you know.
p347_352|but at the same time they made you think about life.
p347_353|it's a very special unit.
p347_354|we will learn lessons from what has happened.
p347_355|i foolishly had done nothing about it.
p347_356|again this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p347_357|by social devices the two groups are coming together.
p347_358|smith has not let him down.
p347_359|which he can do.
p347_360|no it's actually in a block of flats.
p347_361|they were that poor.
p347_362|and we're talking big money.
p347_363|his silence on the issue is interesting.
p347_364|i was a little surprised.
p347_365|it was a bit like having children.
p347_366|with pierre you can never be sure.
p347_367|they believed it worked.
p347_368|i'm really proud of my young players.
p347_369|as it happened it was much more than that.
p347_370|it's an internal matter.
p347_371|they should feel ashamed.
p347_372|you realise what this means?
p347_373|we're delighted about the vote.
p347_374|they were only there for three weeks.
p347_375|i'm just looking to take my chances.
p347_376|public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p347_377|it is just completely erased.
p347_378|to which the only answer is don't hold your breath.
p347_379|it's been like that for ages according to the guys.
p347_380|it's not just for classical music.
p347_381|this must be kept in total perspective.
p347_382|election results are expected soon.
p347_383|all of the names are familiar to me.
p347_384|there are moments of honesty too.
p347_385|they didn't find anything.
p347_386|is that where we are?
p347_387|we used to keep our business rates.
p347_388|it was a lot of hard work but it wasn't difficult.
p347_389|i suspect that it will.
p347_390|but there's no eye contact.
p347_391|there was no energy behind it.
p347_392|they could take the result away from them couldn't they.
p347_393|even for a british open this is different.
p347_394|i took a minibus into town.
p347_395|they have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p347_396|completion is expected by october the following year.
p347_397|it is not a wish list.
p347_398|some of the players have not progressed.
p347_399|they were both very brave.
p347_400|there is no margin for error.
p347_401|why should we even be asked to share?
p347_402|it was not a foul.
p347_403|i get very excited by that.
p347_404|the members have clearly spoken.
p347_405|in the end it will mean an awful lot.
p347_406|i believe in god.
p347_407|which means it matters.
p347_408|there is great potential on this river.
p347_409|we can't win a big game.
p347_410|it was a stunning strike.
p347_411|this is a one year deal but who knows?
p347_412|she said he showed no remorse.
p347_413|we are going through difficult times.
p347_414|there can be no compromise on that demand.
p347_415|what exactly is your job?
p347_416|however there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p347_417|there's nothing for you here.
p347_418|i grew up listening to these people.
p347_419|they wanted to show what they could do.
p347_420|i just want to get rid of it.
p347_421|officials say the city must achieve this.
p347_422|it may mean more money but we don't need the money.
p347_423|i have not come in to take over.
p347_424|is this accurate?
p351_001|please call stella.
p351_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p351_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p351_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p351_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p351_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p351_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p351_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p351_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p351_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p351_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p351_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p351_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p351_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p351_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p351_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p351_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p351_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p351_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p351_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p351_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p351_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p351_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p351_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p351_025|it was by the numbers.
p351_026|i don't think they can complain about that.
p351_027|i have not seen the term immediate.
p351_028|my dad is a hero.
p351_029|it is my fault.
p351_030|he was the bill gates of theatre.
p351_031|he added we have the same desire.
p351_032|thirty schools were closed in the western isles.
p351_033|as a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p351_034|teachers have been given the offer.
p351_035|we have to win every game.
p351_036|they also have good neighbours.
p351_037|both sides will be aware of this.
p351_038|they are not advertised.
p351_039|i have got a wife to feed.
p351_040|we are getting people into work.
p351_041|will we ever play together again?
p351_042|what are the barriers?
p351_043|he is keen to stay in public service.
p351_044|who are the democrats?
p351_045|you had to go and see him.
p351_046|what did you learn in school today?
p351_047|we know we can defend it.
p351_048|that is not the case.
p351_049|he met his wife and married in england.
p351_050|instead we were shot in the back.
p351_051|this isn't a gimmick.
p351_052|i won't go back.
p351_053|there is no signature on this document.
p351_054|we could not compete with rangers.
p351_055|there was mystery back then.
p351_056|we're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p351_057|now it has become a big picture.
p351_058|the jury is still out.
p351_059|hopefully they will not go through with it.
p351_060|they have been very lucky with the ice.
p351_061|we are not the first to be affected.
p351_062|my players are special.
p351_063|we are the gateway to justice.
p351_064|the devil is in the detail.
p351_065|his handling raises a wider issue.
p351_066|we have got the school holidays on.
p351_067|we can't go home.
p351_068|that just wasn't good enough.
p351_069|the working families tax credit is far better.
p351_070|those who are preparing to give up.
p351_071|it's really good as long as we play well.
p351_072|i feel alive and good today.
p351_073|she was married with one son.
p351_074|there may be some work in construction but not enough.
p351_075|it was a pretty terrible day.
p351_076|his track record is impressive.
p351_077|clearly it is very disturbing.
p351_078|it is tough but possible.
p351_079|this youngster is so exciting
p351_080|i don't understand it.
p351_081|the band was good and it's been a great day.
p351_082|he was rejected because he had retired.
p351_083|i just wanted to get off the course.
p351_084|she was also very brave.
p351_085|he promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p351_086|friday night was a pretty good night.
p351_087|things are meant to be.
p351_088|one year later he finally decided to act.
p351_089|that doesn't just happen you have to build it.
p351_090|this is already happening.
p351_091|we have a rehearsal.
p351_092|four had been brought down.
p351_093|only he's not as young as he looks.
p351_094|the matter is under discussion.
p351_095|glasgow however did not get a mention.
p351_096|surely this is not supposed to happen?
p351_097|this is a defining moment in this parliament.
p351_098|they have played their part.
p351_099|they were unable to revive him.
p351_100|he confirmed that the document was valid.
p351_101|in part that reflected the times.
p351_102|that is not true.
p351_103|yes it was too short a night.
p351_104|i didn't deserve to be sent off.
p351_106|we have no excuses.
p351_107|really you will
p351_108|the driver was unhurt.
p351_109|who will pay for this?
p351_110|this is wrong but it's what is believed.
p351_111|you have caught a serial killer.
p351_112|it's all about money money money.
p351_113|what's the problem?
p351_114|finally they have a journey back to their youth.
p351_115|the way forward isn't going to be easy.
p351_116|it's the way we go about it.
p351_117|i will be ridiculed.
p351_118|there's nothing new in that argument.
p351_119|this time it was out of the blue.
p351_120|we need to get the right people in.
p351_121|it is a great shame.
p351_122|we were not going to take that risk.
p351_123|last night he became one of the hunted.
p351_124|but that isn't what is worrying the farmer.
p351_125|pity he couldn't produce a winning british team.
p351_126|in my opinion it was not working perfectly.
p351_127|the truth of course is very different.
p351_128|he has something in common with the wallabies.
p351_129|these will take a little time to develop.
p351_130|i might come back.
p351_131|he said it was the worst possible result.
p351_132|but still it wasn't working.
p351_133|that was my mistake.
p351_134|we can play better than that.
p351_135|my whole family is.
p351_136|however everyone should do it once in their life.
p351_137|a career as a doctor is on hold.
p351_138|during the communist time they were very privileged.
p351_139|there has been no delay on government orders.
p351_140|i think we can overcome it.
p351_141|we will be victorious.
p351_142|the other question is why the scaling down?
p351_143|it was the crowning point of my career.
p351_144|but it will be sorted out this week.
p351_145|it's just a fact.
p351_146|mr smith was dismissive.
p351_147|it was a discussion paper.
p351_148|my neighbours are horrified.
p351_149|they will be ready.
p351_150|bin laden is believed to be left handed.
p351_151|he is walking free.
p351_152|there is nothing they can't do.
p351_153|it certainly was a birthday to remember.
p351_154|if you can work you should work.
p351_155|this was a very tragic accident.
p351_156|the paragon ensemble is back.
p351_157|if you can make it there you can make it anywhere.
p351_158|it is the voice of the survivors.
p351_159|the whole thing in general is moving on.
p351_160|they might also be parlous.
p351_161|paterson can afford to be generous.
p351_162|no other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p351_163|the other is the existence of male colleagues.
p351_164|i'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p351_165|it is not an escape.
p351_166|it feels that the game is off.
p351_167|he is very confident at the moment.
p351_168|well what can you do?
p351_169|it is not the message alone.
p351_170|they will be seen for years to come.
p351_171|i'm really happy with how things went there.
p351_172|he will be greatly missed.
p351_173|sadly they don't seem to know.
p351_174|but is that possible?
p351_175|in many ways that is as important.
p351_176|i think we're going to make it.
p351_177|it was really frustrating.
p351_178|clubs can only do so much.
p351_179|many other areas are coming up.
p351_180|it would have very little impact on them.
p351_181|she didn't tell me anything the night before.
p351_182|that's the way things are heading.
p351_183|we were extremely poor.
p351_184|the parties have no contact.
p351_185|he needed a kidney it is as simple as that.
p351_186|we are still paying the price for that.
p351_187|it was better than a soap opera.
p351_188|there will be no change in government.
p351_189|i am just grateful he is alive.
p351_190|this is a special place for me.
p351_191|this was a great result for us a big result.
p351_192|our policy is clear.
p351_193|this was an hour before the show.
p351_194|it is crucial to understand this in context.
p351_195|i now know that from memory.
p351_196|another one said the couple came from inverness.
p351_197|we expect a full house on the night.
p351_198|he invented the language.
p351_199|we want to play at the worlds.
p351_200|we need to know more about her.
p351_201|i went away to recover fully.
p351_202|ownership was the game.
p351_203|it makes a huge difference.
p351_204|the man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p351_205|it's not a new device.
p351_206|like everything in scotland it takes time.
p351_207|six years is too long.
p351_208|they are not a set of options.
p351_209|it's a very important and beautiful day.
p351_210|if only the problems concerned the players.
p351_211|but it was money well spent.
p351_212|that's the most important thing for me.
p351_213|at the end of the day one has to be careful.
p351_214|no decision has yet been made.
p351_215|i have had a lovely summer.
p351_216|which is fair enough.
p351_217|he took over our lives.
p351_218|the problem is worse in scotland.
p351_219|this is a historic agreement.
p351_220|he had worked there for only two days.
p351_221|we just want them home.
p351_222|his was the best performance of the day after all.
p351_223|i was happily surprised.
p351_224|it may not even be possible.
p351_225|i think it is a scandal.
p351_226|perhaps it was just as well.
p351_227|that though was then.
p351_228|i grew up with them.
p351_229|it was the train coming.
p351_230|i would have the hammer in the crowd.
p351_231|we are pursuing legal action against the government.
p351_232|perhaps that was their mistake.
p351_233|we've never seen so many.
p351_234|the way forward is working with other disciplines.
p351_235|i am very very happy.
p351_236|the case was continued.
p351_237|that is important for the club.
p351_238|he is doing the right things.
p351_239|blood samples were taken.
p351_240|now he is in charge of this.
p351_241|they want to play in the world cup.
p351_242|he was embarrassed about what he did.
p351_243|this is excellent news for the workforce.
p351_244|the home team also had their moments.
p351_245|haven't been so lucky since.
p351_246|he is under no illusions.
p351_247|it got no better.
p351_248|some were close to tears.
p351_249|it has become a way of life.
p351_250|they seem to turn up for them.
p351_251|that is a matter for the scottish parliament.
p351_252|now we are back on top of europe.
p351_253|now the show is for public consumption.
p351_254|i want to create events.
p351_255|i wish it wasn't so but it is.
p351_256|the old manager he didn't like me.
p351_257|we had a court hearing in london yesterday.
p351_258|the ministers are now to make their decision.
p351_259|it was like being in prison.
p351_260|i think it was his parents.
p351_261|that is very important to people.
p351_262|i certainly hope not.
p351_263|this is a dream come true for me.
p351_264|no other country has ever won this tournament.
p351_265|there he goes again.
p351_266|however there could be more bad weather to come.
p351_267|i feel pretty good.
p351_268|it's got to come from me.
p351_269|there were moments of humour too.
p351_270|he has a wealth of experience.
p351_271|don't you think it was a fine performance?
p351_272|it happens from time to time.
p351_273|all my family are in scotland from glasgow.
p351_274|they were too hard.
p351_275|this is not a message from ministers.
p351_276|we have been very patient.
p351_277|i don't take that view.
p351_278|they have a car and cannot afford another.
p351_279|my only concern is for my children.
p351_280|this is welcome news.
p351_281|the criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p351_282|we just wish they had done so before.
p351_283|it was a virus.
p351_284|the rest of course is history.
p351_285|they chose the latter.
p351_286|that was not the norm.
p351_287|i've not said anything to them they know.
p351_288|it is giving out the wrong message.
p351_289|i feel it is very irrational.
p351_290|we were used to being in control.
p351_291|he's had a lot of injury problems.
p351_292|brady lost to sullivan one hole.
p351_293|it happened again and again and again.
p351_294|does it matter?
p351_295|she thought she was going to die.
p351_296|were they under age?
p351_297|you are going to go to jail.
p351_298|it is a very worrying report.
p351_299|i started it but then forgot all about it.
p351_300|my mind was made up.
p351_301|it was an ongoing exercise.
p351_302|i would love to see it back there.
p351_303|he then did just that.
p351_304|he should have won.
p351_305|he could hardly have been in greater demand.
p351_306|who can predict?
p351_307|it was all very proper and civilised.
p351_308|i've played them all in the champions league.
p351_309|then you see it.
p351_310|and it had been a marvellous occasion.
p351_311|we don't believe anything anymore.
p351_312|either system could have prevented the crash.
p351_313|here the fans have been fantastic.
p351_314|there is good quality.
p351_315|for his opposite number this was a just triumph.
p351_316|but these things are happening now.
p351_317|he will be really pleased about this.
p351_318|he had no access to the database.
p351_319|they were not up to the required standard.
p351_320|he also seems to have been around forever.
p351_321|however it has had only a limited uptake.
p351_322|at the moment it is very difficult to know.
p351_323|others are expected to do so soon.
p351_324|they were impressive against france.
p351_325|seven people were already in custody in france.
p351_326|i played well but missed a few chances.
p351_327|our approach will be different.
p351_328|it's my initial background.
p351_329|the board is currently resolving its differences.
p351_330|they're just a nonsense.
p351_331|that has not been the case as we now know.
p351_332|he also called in at another farm.
p351_333|but he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
p351_334|he will go a long way.
p351_335|hopefully he will get a lucky break.
p351_336|i lost a part of me.
p351_337|it's so much more fun.
p351_338|that's just the kind of thing we have.
p351_339|it's getting to me.
p351_340|so we talked about that for a bit.
p351_341|but he has strong links to labour.
p351_342|i am proud of my team.
p351_343|i am a doctor.
p351_344|secondly there are other options for patients.
p351_345|it will carry on.
p351_346|our season is not over.
p351_347|i am not retiring.
p351_348|money is not everything in life.
p351_349|she kept him on a string.
p351_350|it will make a big difference.
p351_351|there was no basis for their arrest.
p351_352|this latter suggestion is very important.
p351_353|the deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p351_354|the government has listened.
p351_355|it's only tackling congestion.
p351_356|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p351_357|it's too horrible to think.
p351_358|it can be frightening.
p351_359|he was but only just.
p351_360|it may be his last for a while too.
p351_362|what's wrong with that?
p351_363|you will never forget the clutching horror.
p351_364|off with their heads.
p351_365|i believe she was elected unopposed.
p351_366|we are not asking for the moon.
p351_367|now we see the impact of global politics.
p351_368|the pain is still acute.
p351_369|this was not the show for me.
p351_370|it is a very big problem.
p351_371|frustration is not the word.
p351_372|the police have to act to help them.
p351_373|the cause is just.
p351_374|it may be down but new york is not out.
p351_375|our message is getting through.
p351_376|but what lies ahead?
p351_377|she makes me so happy.
p351_378|they promised to fight the plans.
p351_379|my heart is not so sure.
p351_380|i am happy for her.
p351_381|finally he paid for the movie.
p351_382|they were just too good for us.
p351_383|he was the architect.
p351_384|this should include procedures for personal imports.
p351_385|it's a fantastic achievement.
p351_386|neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p351_387|police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p351_388|he too was not satisfied.
p351_389|it's easy to see why.
p351_390|but it didn't happen.
p351_391|all were believed to be adults.
p351_392|this is the last straw.
p351_393|the research was my life.
p351_394|i am so so so lucky.
p351_395|what is it about this series?
p351_396|you read it right.
p351_397|they would have been forgiven for doing so.
p351_398|i only wanted to give her a fright.
p351_399|where does it come from?
p351_400|you find it bizarre?
p351_401|i am very excited about this season.
p351_402|it has proved a double whammy.
p351_403|britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p351_404|it should be a great game though.
p351_405|but is he?
p351_406|so it's a daily struggle.
p351_407|but the foreign secretary can cope.
p351_408|if it's not they didn't go far enough.
p351_409|ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p351_410|everyone has his share of trouble.
p351_411|you need a licence to run a pub.
p351_412|everything else is second.
p351_413|i am not sure.
p351_414|this is a successful outcome.
p351_415|his first album was a hit.
p351_416|the salary changes are long overdue.
p351_417|the plane was shaking.
p351_418|it was visibly on fire.
p351_419|what's it for after all?
p351_420|we will be pleased to talk to them.
p351_421|a number of people could not speak english.
p351_422|they have got off with murder.
p351_423|i'm going to take it further.
p351_424|i kept going for her.
p360_001|please call stella.
p360_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p360_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p360_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p360_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p360_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p360_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p360_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p360_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p360_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p360_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p360_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p360_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p360_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p360_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p360_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p360_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p360_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p360_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p360_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p360_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p360_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p360_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p360_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p360_025|you can never take a win for granted.
p360_026|my conscience is not clear.
p360_027|is that it?
p360_028|you have been warned.
p360_029|you are not allowed to do that.
p360_030|that depends on rangers.
p360_031|there are two problems.
p360_032|lose and they would be ridiculed.
p360_033|it's something which is very important to me.
p360_034|for once he was wrong.
p360_035|he would not have to explain.
p360_036|i want to deliver a learning society.
p360_037|we are just happy that hasn't happened.
p360_038|i had to be into it.
p360_039|i'm so grateful for that.
p360_040|it's not been a good year.
p360_041|a similar exercise is expected in scotland.
p360_042|i have no intention of resigning today.
p360_043|that has now gone.
p360_044|donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
p360_045|this will take up to nine months.
p360_046|and maybe they have.
p360_047|next league matches dundee united rangers.
p360_048|is he conscious?
p360_049|but we are confident.
p360_050|it is like a football team.
p360_051|when he came to see me on monday.
p360_052|that's a concern to me.
p360_053|she said she was really sorry.
p360_054|that will be important.
p360_055|but here it is also very bad.
p360_056|that view has not altered.
p360_057|it was very full anyway.
p360_058|as for the warning it was not needed.
p360_059|the incidents are not believed to be linked.
p360_060|but there is no easy option.
p360_061|i can't believe she is dead.
p360_062|no person was charged.
p360_063|but it would say that.
p360_064|most of the works are small in scale.
p360_065|he was pronounced dead at the scene.
p360_066|only the bomber was killed.
p360_067|but he just carried on anyway.
p360_068|nor was it a game without its lessons.
p360_069|it was that kind of afternoon.
p360_070|his presence was very important.
p360_071|what happens next?
p360_072|they couldn't believe what had happened.
p360_073|the bombing begins in five minutes.
p360_074|that took two weeks.
p360_075|it's worth it though.
p360_076|that perhaps is behind the problem.
p360_077|i have to hand it to the bank.
p360_078|the question was simple enough.
p360_079|the voters rejected us.
p360_080|there was a definite prejudice.
p360_081|nothing is going right at the moment.
p360_082|we never publicise it.
p360_083|you will be very welcome.
p360_084|his musicals were very much of their time.
p360_085|he became enchanted with the process.
p360_086|this year the exercise is being repeated.
p360_087|it seems very odd.
p360_088|they couldn't keep it together.
p360_089|we discovered that for ourselves.
p360_090|we will continue to provide support for them.
p360_091|i've always been very taken by the drink.
p360_092|it was looking bad.
p360_093|that's what makes it interesting.
p360_094|it's nice to be involved.
p360_095|it's not a game.
p360_096|buildings are about people.
p360_097|there is much work to do.
p360_098|the release attracted little attention.
p360_099|it was the dreaded sentence.
p360_100|i have never considered it.
p360_101|it is not in the public interest.
p360_102|they had been forced to walk.
p360_103|it is harder than you think.
p360_104|the call was ignored.
p360_105|i am looking forward to it.
p360_106|consumers will also benefit.
p360_107|that would be even more disastrous.
p360_108|we opened up and everything was gone.
p360_109|it is looking very special.
p360_110|they offered to make an investment into it.
p360_111|people were hitting the floor.
p360_112|she was close to suicide at one stage.
p360_113|they took a risk.
p360_114|mr docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p360_115|it has no place in football.
p360_116|it is frustrating that we cannot do that.
p360_117|this is a classic.
p360_118|he played it like a veteran.
p360_119|i have spoken to head office.
p360_120|i'm not thinking about anyone else.
p360_121|they will run a mile.
p360_122|when she went off it was quite amazing.
p360_123|britain has never had it so good.
p360_124|so many people will be affected by this.
p360_125|it was all very good stuff.
p360_126|or was it?
p360_127|we are under no illusions about this.
p360_128|but they are a good team.
p360_129|we have a long way to go.
p360_130|i hope it has helped the prisoners.
p360_131|scotland is an increasing concern for young people.
p360_132|i knew that we needed to get out.
p360_133|i had a train to catch.
p360_134|and this game is all about belief.
p360_135|i am ready for that.
p360_136|it is a fantasy.
p360_137|the only safe investment is cash.
p360_138|that's the way they are.
p360_139|elections would follow in about two years.
p360_140|we are trying to be realistic.
p360_141|that was the theory.
p360_142|or so it seemed.
p360_143|now we look forward to it.
p360_144|that was worth it.
p360_145|what's it going to be then?
p360_146|who was being affected?
p360_147|our players are exhausted.
p360_148|it is deeply frustrating.
p360_149|he suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p360_150|we've had an enjoyable adventure.
p360_151|this has been carried out.
p360_152|our time is up.
p360_153|it was a moment of madness.
p360_154|but other ministers are not convinced.
p360_155|first meeting was next week.
p360_156|no we were not exactly favourites.
p360_157|conditions were very difficult for the players.
p360_158|this solution is not being considered in scotland.
p360_159|i didn't think we deserved to go out.
p360_160|however we will have to wait and see.
p360_161|i told them they shouldn't say that.
p360_162|i don't know how they do it.
p360_163|little is known about them.
p360_164|it is a new company for scotland.
p360_165|we're very unhappy about it.
p360_166|a good actor doesn't think.
p360_167|but the action is about to be restarted.
p360_168|it was extremely difficult.
p360_169|it is about the script for me.
p360_170|i have a good feeling about this.
p360_171|and the results were impressive.
p360_172|the next game is today.
p360_173|hopefully it will be a good day.
p360_174|i was a silly bastard.
p360_175|there is an ongoing problem with this company.
p360_176|the process will start tomorrow.
p360_177|was the punishment excessive?
p360_178|the police have an awful lot to explain.
p360_179|that's when you hope to take advantage.
p360_180|i could easy do that.
p360_181|we are really impressed.
p360_182|i try to be clear in the narrative.
p360_183|you have to wait.
p360_184|i did not see anything to begin with.
p360_185|it's their moment of choice.
p360_186|i certainly do not agree with that.
p360_187|it was a disaster of a race.
p360_188|only one person can claim the credit.
p360_189|maintain the highest standards.
p360_190|what could we do?
p360_191|o neill has delivered.
p360_192|but there was no going back.
p360_193|there are some good people in there.
p360_194|but it won't make a difference.
p360_195|i'm not going to blame the band.
p360_196|i think that he got the message.
p360_197|here it was very subdued.
p360_198|stardom is a funny thing.
p360_199|they are protesting but they know it cannot go on.
p360_200|the atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
p360_201|i sincerely hope not.
p360_202|i'm really looking forward to that.
p360_203|she would say he was still the best.
p360_204|it is dangerous and it is a lie.
p360_205|we didn't and it worked for us.
p360_206|no one has used it since then.
p360_207|the baby was dead.
p360_208|that remains the unanswered question.
p360_209|everyone is too upset to comment.
p360_210|they tried to give her advice.
p360_211|we should have no more problems.
p360_212|pensions are a long term investment.
p360_213|an announcement is expected soon.
p360_214|it was one of those things.
p360_215|i can understand that.
p360_216|but sometimes it was even worse.
p360_217|we had to work hard for it.
p360_218|that's a big reduction.
p360_219|there will be good prospects ahead.
p360_220|i was pleased about that.
p360_221|that has not changed.
p360_222|it's a creative energy.
p360_223|we are not conducting the review.
p360_224|it just never comes together.
p360_225|the club has never won it.
p360_226|his leader wanted to celebrate.
p360_227|so it was at easter road.
p360_228|it will be a huge difference.
p360_229|labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p360_230|the characters are always the first attraction.
p360_231|we've got better players here.
p360_232|we are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p360_233|this is wonderful news.
p360_234|so what's it all about?
p360_235|i think he was lost for words.
p360_236|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p360_237|i want to celebrate the world cup.
p360_238|this is a historic occasion.
p360_239|no one expected that their parents would stay.
p360_240|and what happens?
p360_241|it is all very upbeat.
p360_242|i'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p360_243|we're looking for unity in the council.
p360_244|the observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p360_245|we deserved the draw.
p360_246|just one of those things we suppose.
p360_247|it's up to the defence team.
p360_248|no one was injured.
p360_249|we have had our debate.
p360_250|it is part of his game.
p360_251|did he just want to be on telly?
p360_252|but it was too late.
p360_253|i didn't see the point.
p360_254|it seems a shame to leave it.
p360_255|who would have thought it?
p360_256|they were all on a mission.
p360_257|human beings are always the same.
p360_258|you will gain from that.
p360_259|it makes me feel difficult.
p360_260|we couldn't believe it at first.
p360_261|the distinction is also supported by doctors.
p360_262|he could still be president.
p360_263|it can take a long time.
p360_264|i don't intend to do so now.
p360_265|there is no answer to it.
p360_266|he was pleased with his display.
p360_267|the first time you read a play.
p360_268|there was no let up for the minnows.
p360_269|the bottom line is that this must stop.
p360_270|he is having a nightmare.
p360_271|that was six years ago.
p360_272|players have to accept this.
p360_273|he is completely committed to us.
p360_274|neither had the public.
p360_275|it disappeared into the cup.
p360_276|they might well be right.
p360_277|i have no further comment to make.
p360_278|the warning is timely.
p360_279|those were the days.
p360_280|the joint bid is still on course.
p360_281|a press conference is about politics.
p360_282|it was important to bring them all together.
p360_283|we didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p360_284|they tend to be female and retired.
p360_285|these things happen in football but shouldn't.
p360_286|it looks as though he will be right.
p360_287|we know the fight is going to happen.
p360_288|i have played well the past two days.
p360_289|is it on a building site?
p360_290|that is the key.
p360_291|we've been here before.
p360_292|i am in a good position.
p360_293|i have never been unemployed.
p360_294|we are in it for the long term.
p360_295|but it didn't bother me.
p360_296|i believe it will happen.
p360_297|and michael was just great.
p360_298|he did it well.
p360_299|why have you decided to get married?
p360_300|is it all real?
p360_301|he will be missed.
p360_302|i would not descend to that level.
p360_303|they were not at the property yesterday.
p360_304|we will not tolerate it.
p360_305|i'm really proud of her.
p360_306|what does this mean?
p360_307|they are not falling now.
p360_308|we are not physical at all.
p360_309|have we not been here before?
p360_310|i've been waiting a long time.
p360_311|the meaning is very profound and complex.
p360_312|you just have to get on with it.
p360_313|the response from everyone was wonderful.
p360_314|and that match was played in june.
p360_315|we are looking for scotland to be inspired.
p360_316|i don't mean in a frightening way.
p360_317|he is a sort of a mystery figure.
p360_318|i have learned a lot.
p360_319|it won't be their last.
p360_320|you've got to have both sides.
p360_321|he has yet to receive a reply.
p360_322|it has been only average.
p360_323|he should be worried about me.
p360_324|hopefully it will be good enough.
p360_325|for me any manager is good.
p360_326|eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p360_327|that was the gimmick.
p360_328|he refused to name the survivors.
p360_329|he has changed my life forever.
p360_330|i have no idea.
p360_331|this plan is all about respect.
p360_332|i don't think he played his best.
p360_333|pakistan denied the report.
p360_334|it will be up to the government.
p360_335|that is a tragedy.
p360_336|i am very happy.
p360_337|a child is not a product.
p360_338|but this is nonsense.
p360_339|you can't get the experience in austria.
p360_340|i'm going to miss it.
p360_341|there will be no backing down.
p360_342|the atmosphere was excellent.
p360_343|that must have had an effect.
p360_344|they have brought in the replacement.
p360_345|how did it all come about?
p360_346|we are working so hard.
p360_347|one was a lawyer.
p360_348|our position is extremely simple.
p360_349|where did that finish?
p360_350|i suppose it is quite exciting really.
p360_351|the most important thing was to win today.
p360_352|golf is not like that.
p360_353|this is a moment to seize.
p360_354|i would not do that.
p360_355|lots of them haven't recovered that far.
p360_356|they said that they stood by their statement.
p360_357|that is a trend which will be encouraged.
p360_358|that has to be allowed.
p360_359|he has never let them down.
p360_360|there was no one of the required standard.
p360_361|that would be very good for rangers.
p360_362|it's something he has worked very hard on.
p360_363|it is time to fight a decisive battle.
p360_364|that gives it a spirit.
p360_365|she has never been back.
p360_366|it will set the tone.
p360_367|they are not going away.
p360_368|having done it he was asked again.
p360_369|i think he will.
p360_370|the package is a changing one.
p360_371|i'm working on that one too.
p360_372|frankly that's not good enough.
p360_373|or is it?
p360_374|what's the difference?
p360_375|the whole family was in shock.
p360_376|but everywhere the problems are the same.
p360_377|craig is a major concern for us.
p360_378|the problems began a long time ago.
p360_379|it meant a lot to us.
p360_380|what other retailer would do this?
p360_381|other musicians were found in retirement.
p360_382|this country has many challenges.
p360_383|their families are gone.
p360_384|is tony blair on drugs?
p360_385|i didn't do it.
p360_386|they are with their father.
p360_387|they're all doing it.
p360_388|i can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p360_389|no they are not the same thing.
p360_390|in football it is not always the case.
p360_391|sometimes we find a person.
p360_392|it is a natural reaction.
p360_393|i am in a very difficult position.
p360_394|i had to win this race.
p360_395|they could have been told in advance.
p360_396|and what do we have?
p360_397|it is a relief.
p360_398|the boat was fantastic.
p360_399|these were the edited highlights.
p360_400|that is the difference.
p360_401|you will need it.
p360_402|there is so much at stake.
p360_403|it has great potential.
p360_404|they had three children.
p360_405|it was all too little too late.
p360_406|still it is a very good result for us.
p360_407|and he's not alone.
p360_408|what was all that about?
p360_409|what's the problem with change?
p360_410|i intend to end it on a high.
p360_411|what she can't have is the money.
p360_412|i thought they played well.
p360_413|this is not the end.
p360_414|and they went on to win the title.
p360_415|now she will not be running at all.
p360_416|it's not an impression.
p360_417|this was great for our sport.
p360_418|there's no place to hide.
p360_419|i don't think they are too serious.
p360_420|tiger is the exception.
p360_421|there was no happy ending.
p360_422|they need time to think.
p360_423|it's unfair on her.
p360_424|as for owen class is permanent.
p361_001|please call stella.
p361_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p361_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p361_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p361_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p361_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p361_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p361_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p361_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p361_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p361_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p361_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p361_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p361_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p361_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p361_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p361_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p361_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p361_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p361_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p361_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p361_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p361_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p361_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p361_025|something has to be done.
p361_026|that is where the damage has been done.
p361_027|he may not need to force that message.
p361_028|these decisions are not simple.
p361_029|the results were very clear.
p361_030|we must convince the citizens.
p361_031|i decided it is going to be william.
p361_032|but we need to keep it there.
p361_033|it is a case of taking a risk.
p361_034|i am really ready for it now.
p361_035|he was jailed for four years.
p361_036|we felt it was sufficient.
p361_037|this decision is folly.
p361_038|and this was well known?
p361_039|it took two minutes to respond.
p361_040|why you did it will never be known.
p361_041|he was in his element.
p361_042|that means an extra two years.
p361_043|so we have to go back.
p361_044|i'm sure he does.
p361_045|he was found again almost a year later.
p361_046|the answer was wrong.
p361_047|they need to be helped.
p361_048|it is all starting to come together.
p361_049|i am the fastest player on the course.
p361_050|it is the tip of the iceberg.
p361_051|they were taken to prove a point.
p361_052|it doesn't have to be in inverness.
p361_053|it is an important step forward.
p361_054|a final agreement has not yet been completed.
p361_055|and they removed a borderer.
p361_056|that is the way it is.
p361_057|that was something else.
p361_058|this resulted in the following.
p361_059|i want to deal with this stuff.
p361_060|we will be patient but we will win.
p361_061|as good as they come.
p361_062|it is not for me to say.
p361_063|for that much we must be grateful.
p361_064|but the law is very clear on this.
p361_065|i thought it was quite a positive result.
p361_066|but we are very near.
p361_067|nobody else is at risk.
p361_068|we are not going to back off.
p361_069|he said it was for sale.
p361_070|we have a strong team at the moment.
p361_071|this is a dream come true.
p361_072|the problem is not confined to the uk.
p361_073|it is on the news.
p361_074|they said there was nothing.
p361_075|they were looking for things.
p361_076|i've got to be better than that quite.
p361_077|i wouldn't give them a grade.
p361_078|as it should be.
p361_079|we have never been short of volunteers.
p361_080|but who is it?
p361_081|kenny miller might come through.
p361_082|workers will now be balloted on the offer.
p361_083|it just isn't there.
p361_084|drama is not one of them.
p361_085|and we have a singer.
p361_086|it was exactly four months away.
p361_087|this is a personal decision for me.
p361_088|it's just a failing service.
p361_089|we all want to be left alone.
p361_090|i was saying no.
p361_091|where are they?
p361_092|i am delighted to hear this news.
p361_093|i knew him a little.
p361_094|they just have a go.
p361_095|if it's going in it goes in.
p361_096|nobody called me to explain.
p361_097|you didn't get a modified.
p361_098|what kind of person is he?
p361_099|seriously we are not concerned at all.
p361_100|what has changed since then?
p361_101|he knows he is good.
p361_102|i welcome the decision.
p361_103|it could take some time.
p361_104|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p361_105|it may be tomorrow but it may be later.
p361_106|i've done a lot in that building.
p361_107|music is all consuming.
p361_108|the results are very positive.
p361_109|talk of a crisis is absurd.
p361_110|which is where we come in.
p361_111|i'm not looking forward to it.
p361_112|next league matches aberdeen dundee united.
p361_113|he is a pro.
p361_114|they have to tell it as it is.
p361_115|this could easily have been another tragedy.
p361_116|you should enjoy the day.
p361_117|he was taken ill in his office.
p361_118|we couldn't get enough of it.
p361_119|cost is a factor but not the only one.
p361_120|i am not very pleased.
p361_121|it is just a statement of fact.
p361_122|it was on my mind a little bit.
p361_123|i will just have to be patient.
p361_124|i didn't think about it again.
p361_125|and if they fail?
p361_126|he has gone through the process before.
p361_127|social workers are on stand by to help.
p361_128|we've always had something to do.
p361_129|how do you take them away?
p361_130|it will be released in october.
p361_132|that got me out.
p361_133|it is called a killing in the trade.
p361_134|it's a matter for the committee.
p361_135|it will have to ratify the deal.
p361_136|i've never seen anything like it.
p361_137|it was highly successful.
p361_138|we needed someone and we now have him.
p361_139|it has to find out what went wrong.
p361_140|only one was from glasgow.
p361_141|i'm sure he will be aware of it.
p361_142|until you hit the big games.
p361_143|they received no money under the merger.
p361_144|it was a big departure.
p361_145|she has never mentioned it.
p361_146|i want my mum.
p361_147|it seems to have been an own goal.
p361_148|or someone wants to say something different.
p361_149|there are no second chances.
p361_150|and it was great for me.
p361_151|i am extremely sad.
p361_152|this series is for real.
p361_153|it has still to be recovered.
p361_154|the conclusion is the same.
p361_155|i wish they would commit to us.
p361_156|the driver just insulted me.
p361_157|something has to be put in place.
p361_158|hopefully he will get a lucky break.
p361_159|it's a mixture of everything.
p361_160|that is the sensible outcome.
p361_161|you can see the appeal of running away.
p361_162|this means a lot of hard decisions.
p361_163|that comes at a cost.
p361_164|and so did the rest of her team.
p361_165|he tells the truth and that's important.
p361_166|those are difficult decisions.
p361_167|the omens are not good.
p361_168|the game was there to be won.
p361_169|then there's the casting.
p361_170|there is no signature.
p361_171|we can't go on like this.
p361_172|it is a very demanding course.
p361_173|can he do it?
p361_174|the quality of life is difficult for them.
p361_175|i've won the british.
p361_176|if they wish to go they can go.
p361_177|however it was a different story in the final.
p361_178|i was just aghast.
p361_179|they get money for it now.
p361_180|i could have been offended.
p361_181|that's not the way to think.
p361_182|i can see it now.
p361_183|then everyone must consider their future.
p361_184|there was nothing she could do.
p361_185|we want to be part of it.
p361_186|it was a bit of a shock.
p361_187|it's not long enough.
p361_188|this is positive and welcome.
p361_189|now he is back on top again.
p361_190|actors like to be in the centre.
p361_191|anything less will not do.
p361_192|failure is not an option.
p361_193|that is clearly not happening fast enough.
p361_194|we were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p361_195|you look at that.
p361_196|they will be very physical.
p361_197|it has been well worth it.
p361_198|it was just a feeling.
p361_199|people are trying to run away.
p361_200|on the face of it this is excellent news.
p361_201|this is clearly not abuse.
p361_202|he should be careful.
p361_203|everyone knew the family.
p361_204|i am prepared to step down.
p361_205|translation we got it wrong.
p361_206|we will be working on that this week all right.
p361_207|these are serious matters.
p361_208|the pace is telling.
p361_209|she has always been very friendly.
p361_210|their loss is heartbreaking.
p361_211|it is his script.
p361_212|i am a socialist.
p361_213|the response was really good.
p361_214|the squad is too small.
p361_215|you can blame the defence.
p361_216|usually the enjoyment is two ways.
p361_217|it just could be a good night.
p361_218|but we were wrong.
p361_219|this has gone on too long.
p361_220|it is an outrage.
p361_221|it is a performance.
p361_222|it is the best place.
p361_223|we tried to get them down.
p361_224|there were other problems for brown yesterday.
p361_225|i don't know the full story.
p361_226|part time staff are being laid off.
p361_227|mind you it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p361_228|but they have taken the lesson to heart.
p361_229|i just want him to win a tournament.
p361_230|eight others are also believed to have died.
p361_231|this time he will be more on the defensive.
p361_232|i will never see my son again.
p361_233|but it is being pursued.
p361_234|he knew they were there.
p361_235|that would end it for us.
p361_236|we didn't and it cost us the game.
p361_237|it attracted no complaints.
p361_238|neil is never going to come back.
p361_239|the years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p361_240|four of the victims were women.
p361_241|he was also very happy to listen.
p361_242|it's to do with this place.
p361_243|it's a technical demand.
p361_244|sadly it is a mess.
p361_245|that has to take its toll.
p361_246|we want to see the maximum of change.
p361_247|but those days are dead and gone.
p361_248|however we must not be complacent.
p361_249|and that was just the start.
p361_250|nothing was meant by it.
p361_251|that was my last game.
p361_252|colour is another problem.
p361_253|it is not just the agencies.
p361_254|it came in bits and pieces.
p361_255|you don't see that.
p361_256|they seem to be anyway.
p361_257|i thought they were just excited.
p361_258|he will appear in court today.
p361_259|or is he?
p361_260|was he confident about his prospects?
p361_261|what can you do?
p361_262|it's been very difficult.
p361_263|do something that we need.
p361_264|there is no other offer on the table.
p361_265|when she returned it was a wreck.
p361_266|nobody is pushing out to the right.
p361_267|it is difficult to say.
p361_268|he is not the only one.
p361_269|we call it marriage.
p361_270|full back was a bit of the unknown.
p361_271|it's not the tour.
p361_272|so what is the secret of the success?
p361_273|my husband was fighting for his life.
p361_274|so was the first half.
p361_275|it is still under discussion with the board.
p361_276|that is one point of view.
p361_277|we are in this for the long haul.
p361_278|here we go then.
p361_279|no reason was given.
p361_280|i can't wait for it to come out.
p361_281|i am really sorry that he is going.
p361_282|indeed that has already begun.
p361_283|but it's the truth.
p361_284|we have been here before.
p361_285|and he did that.
p361_286|and she is very clear on this.
p361_287|his remarks were disgraceful.
p361_288|i did not think it was very proper.
p361_289|i have really noticed that this week.
p361_290|in a way he was.
p361_291|i will never forget that.
p361_292|it was considered to be topical.
p361_293|well that's all right then.
p361_294|no one is a winner in this.
p361_295|who wants to be a millionaire?
p361_296|what do you think?
p361_297|they went back to the seventeenth.
p361_298|if we don't do it someone else will.
p361_299|again there was no detail.
p361_300|let the voters decide.
p361_301|then it will come.
p361_302|it should be easy.
p361_303|is it worth it?
p361_304|i will build a house on the site.
p361_305|we are right at the heart of europe.
p361_306|i do my job.
p361_307|they have to get that sorted.
p361_308|that is a dangerous assumption.
p361_309|does it make a profit?
p361_310|i think it's a good sign.
p361_311|a winter of discontent awaits.
p361_312|i knew him well.
p361_313|i am not ready to walk away.
p361_314|many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p361_315|they are already there.
p361_316|i'd never given up on myself.
p361_317|the concerns were unfounded.
p361_318|it doesn't look good for her.
p361_319|it was a management problem in the hospital.
p361_320|i have some comments.
p361_321|you have to be realistic.
p361_322|there was nowhere for him to go.
p361_323|not that he was complaining.
p361_324|we are very proud of him.
p361_325|there they were making excuses for him.
p361_326|it just got out of control.
p361_327|every case is completely different.
p361_328|it's all about unfinished business.
p361_329|our own people are coming over on friday.
p361_330|in scotland there should be vigilance.
p361_331|it will be fine.
p361_332|yet the job is far from over.
p361_333|he has a point.
p361_334|he should emerge as the winner.
p361_335|it is our other home.
p361_336|when you think you cannot go on you can.
p361_337|what a difference a game can make.
p361_338|it is their day.
p361_339|they are a very good side without a doubt.
p361_340|they are used to it.
p361_341|and we are doing it.
p361_342|it's just not good enough.
p361_343|i have a cold.
p361_344|you've got to hand it to them.
p361_345|next league matches aberdeen dundee.
p361_346|it was his own decision.
p361_347|this is still happening in the us.
p361_348|and that was the real problem.
p361_349|but then the problems began.
p361_350|it wasn't about her singing though.
p361_351|from the opening could it be magic?
p361_352|the duties are still to be drawn up.
p361_353|that there would be discussions.
p361_354|it must not happen.
p361_355|that would be unsafe.
p361_356|i did not go looking anywhere else.
p361_357|we had no idea what was going on.
p361_358|if only it had been.
p361_359|so far it is no more.
p361_360|seven people were critically injured.
p361_361|i am very sorry to be here.
p361_362|he could have given them a lot.
p361_363|it was up to him.
p361_364|it's going to happen.
p361_365|i don't think so.
p361_366|and that was just about that.
p361_367|by hard work is the answer.
p361_368|it is really special to me.
p361_369|this is a major step forward.
p361_370|they haven't got the uniform.
p361_371|well you don't have time.
p361_372|it is very funny.
p361_373|i just hope it's not tonight against us.
p361_374|this is good news for the industry.
p361_375|there are no quick fixes.
p361_376|because they didn't want to know.
p361_377|what do we have to do?
p361_378|i have never seen anything like it.
p361_379|it's about new yorkers.
p361_380|that was a real challenge.
p361_381|they will give it a couple of years.
p361_382|he certainly would have approved.
p361_383|conditions were less than ideal.
p361_384|we want this place to work.
p361_385|father is on the train.
p361_386|it could have been prevented.
p361_387|we have been going for three years.
p361_388|firstly we don't know we can do this.
p361_389|i think it was entirely the right decision.
p361_390|it is planned for london in the spring.
p361_391|everything is coming together well.
p361_392|they would have to go to the royal.
p361_393|but we are not afraid of them.
p361_394|it didn't matter who was in their way.
p361_395|that will be the criteria for the future.
p361_396|they thought they couldn't get any.
p361_397|he was too good for me too consistent.
p361_398|i am delighted to have her back home.
p361_399|this idea is a good starting point.
p361_400|she had denied the charge.
p361_401|it was cynical and callous.
p361_402|it's a dead end.
p361_403|what sort of man is that?
p361_404|the message was clear.
p361_405|we are going nowhere.
p361_406|it is truly masterly performance.
p361_407|she failed to win any of them.
p361_408|it is believed he had been stabbed.
p361_409|wednesday night was a difficult time for britton.
p361_410|it has a rally instead of a conference.
p361_411|i found that we couldn't.
p361_412|he is very sensitive.
p361_413|that can benefit the larger companies.
p361_414|i am still waiting for a reply.
p361_415|we told them in july.
p361_416|this was a very tragic accident.
p361_417|we are very very confident.
p361_418|it is a result we should savour.
p361_419|everyone in britain is proud of this team.
p361_420|we certainly do not intend to disband.
p361_421|my life is going to go on.
p361_422|it's really part of our mission.
p361_423|that was only the start.
p361_424|but what took them so long?
p362_001|please call stella.
p362_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p362_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p362_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p362_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p362_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p362_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p362_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p362_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p362_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p362_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p362_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p362_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p362_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p362_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p362_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p362_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p362_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p362_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p362_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p362_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p362_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p362_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p362_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p362_025|we are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p362_026|this is your country.
p362_027|yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p362_028|i feel really good.
p362_029|it was a fairy tale.
p362_030|but there are no plans.
p362_031|they responded in the most positive way.
p362_032|i have a very strong opinion about this.
p362_033|the british government said she was coming home.
p362_034|we are a peaceful people.
p362_035|his mother was english.
p362_036|he was jailed for five years.
p362_037|it's not big brother at sea.
p362_038|was this a new event?
p362_039|to beat the european champion is quite nice.
p362_040|they had a confession.
p362_041|as agreed the prime minister was driven to westminster hall.
p362_042|the chances were plentiful.
p362_043|they were impressive against france.
p362_044|this is only one example.
p362_045|his style is suited to scottish football.
p362_046|the cause is just.
p362_047|i am so upset.
p362_048|england could not take anything for granted however.
p362_049|they finished second and third.
p362_050|but this was refused.
p362_051|meanwhile the action is spreading to eastern europe.
p362_052|hasn't let anyone down?
p362_053|we've always had three options and none of them are perfect.
p362_054|we certainly hope we have been successful.
p362_055|he is one of them.
p362_056|this was no accident.
p362_057|he is a law unto himself.
p362_058|it is a sign of hope.
p362_059|with him are the symbols of his faith.
p362_060|they're interested only in profits.
p362_061|and there has been a good start.
p362_062|i feel my parents are in new york.
p362_063|policing the profession is important.
p362_064|seems a sensible compromise.
p362_065|she had no chance.
p362_066|in the meantime you just have to get on with it.
p362_067|i don't have a problem with it.
p362_068|how is he enjoying life as a senior?
p362_069|it's more relaxing this way.
p362_070|allison is not convinced.
p362_071|we have to move forward from now on.
p362_072|and it was this one.
p362_073|i am going to win the next two.
p362_074|she's afraid of life.
p362_075|but there is good and bad.
p362_076|the real problem is the usher hall.
p362_077|that is her job.
p362_078|they have broken that promise.
p362_079|i don't know what it means.
p362_080|i found the course inspiring.
p362_081|i have to accept that.
p362_082|it means the margin for error is tight.
p362_083|i thought he was part of the camera.
p362_084|she is now on the back benches.
p362_085|it is not a road of life.
p362_086|three bystanders were killed.
p362_087|one is investment one is reform.
p362_088|they could not have done more for me.
p362_089|there has been no cover up just the opposite in fact.
p362_090|it benefits the whole family.
p362_091|it's not my fault.
p362_092|my husband was angry.
p362_093|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p362_094|instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p362_095|sure this is a very important event for me.
p362_096|they have to work so hard.
p362_097|well was it?
p362_098|i thought he was my friend.
p362_099|what kind of person is he?
p362_100|there's a strong involvement.
p362_101|this is complete nonsense.
p362_102|this government is cutting taxes.
p362_103|the israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p362_104|they know their son was murdered.
p362_105|most of them were one year conscripts.
p362_106|so is that it then?
p362_107|the task is enormous.
p362_108|i know he meant it.
p362_109|a the media has been great.
p362_110|there have been so many.
p362_111|sacking john redwood is a disaster.
p362_112|of course it is nonsense.
p362_113|i've never felt affection for emu.
p362_114|he had returned to die.
p362_115|anyone can take a photo.
p362_116|he is involved in everything.
p362_117|no person was charged.
p362_118|you see my back has gone.
p362_119|he's a nice guy.
p362_120|the fire was still coming down.
p362_121|it's always the way.
p362_122|i got the surprise of my life.
p362_123|it will be tight.
p362_124|he seems to be used to the attention.
p362_125|both are national treasures.
p362_126|i accept that but it is very upsetting.
p362_127|well you don't have time.
p362_128|i had never done anything like it before.
p362_129|i feel it's time to make the switch.
p362_130|but he thought the overall results were good.
p362_131|stewart will travel with some confidence.
p362_132|i had been hoping for justice.
p362_133|labour is providing none of these.
p362_134|the building was starting to come down.
p362_135|no other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p362_136|there is enormous interest in scotland the brand.
p362_137|there is a subtle difference.
p362_138|he has created the confusion.
p362_139|he didn't get out much.
p362_140|she was very different.
p362_141|that is my dream.
p362_142|off duty nurses were called in at ayr.
p362_143|the problem is not confined to glasgow.
p362_144|since then they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p362_145|the choice is simple.
p362_146|who is going to pay their wages?
p362_147|i don't think we deserved to lose.
p362_148|it was that kind of match.
p362_149|we couldn't believe it at first.
p362_150|feel the air the space.
p362_151|i have nothing to regret.
p362_152|mrs thatcher was in the right place at the right time.
p362_153|a century on little has changed.
p362_154|wrong decisions address in full
p362_155|i asked to take it up to glasgow.
p362_156|he is having a nightmare.
p362_157|and he still is.
p362_158|however the story has a happy ending.
p362_159|you never had it so good.
p362_160|even for a british open this is different.
p362_161|then he did it twice.
p362_162|so is the rest of british sport.
p362_163|genetic assessment is crucial.
p362_164|it was his greatest movie performance.
p362_165|we go back a long way.
p362_166|so easy does it.
p362_167|not that he's declined.
p362_168|people also have trouble with the currency.
p362_169|i always wanted her to be happy.
p362_170|we've got to get back to normal.
p362_171|do we want to see it?
p362_172|that is for certain.
p362_173|an inquiry has begun.
p362_174|i was a little surprised.
p362_175|that is not however the case.
p362_176|only two players have done it.
p362_177|he is a master of deceit and delay.
p362_178|he doesn't need to be told he knows the truth.
p362_179|what was that all about?
p362_180|this is a fine appointment.
p362_181|that was the finest moment in my career.
p362_182|england will be quite prepared.
p362_183|he is appealing to women.
p362_184|there is no conflict of interest.
p362_185|she has the biggest part.
p362_186|film music was never the same again.
p362_187|it was a deeply moving musical experience.
p362_188|i thought he was at fault.
p362_189|the first minister is an addict.
p362_190|we will win this tie.
p362_191|i think he's done it a few times.
p362_192|something happened on that island.
p362_193|this is a business.
p362_194|last year it was won by jack mcconnell the first minister.
p362_195|i never had any real direction at school.
p362_196|that's how it works.
p362_197|it is quite a young team so the future is there.
p362_198|do what you want to do.
p362_199|we know the quality of life goes up.
p362_200|who are the public?
p362_201|when it is ready it will be signed.
p362_203|but we have learned that it doesn't.
p362_204|i'm looking forward to coming home.
p362_205|they should not be blamed for it.
p362_206|he is indeed the grandson of travelling folk.
p362_207|glasgow is a very welcoming place.
p362_208|it was crucial strike.
p362_209|i have no secrets.
p362_210|what do you want to say?
p362_211|i was so relieved.
p362_212|they continue to do so.
p362_213|i think that's a bit of an invasion.
p362_214|it is a worry.
p362_215|we are not a retailer we provide a service.
p362_216|that is highly unfair.
p362_217|they are not the answer to staff shortages.
p362_218|gas is too expensive.
p362_219|this plan is an agenda for action.
p362_220|it was all relative.
p362_221|and within itself it is visionary.
p362_222|are you up for business?
p362_223|it is true but it is only part of the issue.
p362_224|you are not in any kind of trouble.
p362_225|it also makes for interesting viewing.
p362_226|life becomes a song.
p362_227|no wonder he missed the conversion.
p362_228|sadly they did not.
p362_229|we have nowhere to go.
p362_230|he has every right to do that.
p362_231|jacques chirac the french president was surely in his sights.
p362_232|that had never happened.
p362_233|however our players will fight for that.
p362_234|they are not suitable.
p362_235|he is advised that he has done so.
p362_236|you mean he didn't get the girl?
p362_237|he now lives in edinburgh with his wife caroline.
p362_238|the prime minister has been in touch.
p362_239|but the killing will continue.
p362_240|they've got to get better.
p362_241|but we are working together for this result.
p362_242|mental health is a massive issue.
p362_243|it doesn't make them evil.
p362_244|we don't want to be too intrusive.
p362_245|the most important thing is the game.
p362_246|he said nothing of the sort.
p362_247|this would give scotland around eight members.
p362_248|in saying that you just have to get on with it.
p362_249|the door is open.
p362_250|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p362_251|such adjustments have been the salvation of united.
p362_252|lara is very very much a girl.
p362_253|so what went wrong?
p362_254|we did not play well.
p362_255|we are in a very strong position.
p362_256|this will have no effect on the championship.
p362_257|that is the key.
p362_258|so how did you do?
p362_259|well until recently he didn't think so.
p362_260|it was however the wrong side.
p362_261|i can't deny that fact.
p362_262|she is now planning a visit.
p362_263|we could have done without this.
p362_264|boy is the town a mess.
p362_265|substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p362_266|he's a great dealer.
p362_267|here he is in effect appointing himself a judge.
p362_268|i want to concentrate on the real issues.
p362_269|he is an excellent defender strong and quick.
p362_270|we are moving on.
p362_271|this is not a crisis.
p362_272|there's always a chance.
p362_273|i have come here to fight the boxer not the fans.
p362_274|for me it's a tension you can feel.
p362_275|for some it might not make too much difference.
p362_276|that's a very serious matter.
p362_277|they have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p362_278|but it was to no avail.
p362_279|sad to say it's still waiting.
p362_280|it has been a major success.
p362_281|it takes a bit of working out.
p362_282|i want my country to be a republic not an empire.
p362_283|but it didn't bother me.
p362_284|i'm just feeling very tired but it's great.
p362_285|i'm very relaxed about that indeed.
p362_286|he will not be coming back.
p362_287|he is also a great finisher.
p362_288|i don't see any problem.
p362_289|it's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p362_290|yet it seemed to work.
p362_291|let us hope it doesn't come to that.
p362_292|i have never felt so well.
p362_293|there are other things going on.
p362_294|all is now forgiven.
p362_295|so who is right?
p362_296|and this tournament will travel.
p362_297|there will be new memories.
p362_298|without approval the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p362_299|we know the goals will come.
p362_300|how can they get one?
p362_301|it was an insult.
p362_302|but we all have to look at ourselves.
p362_303|we have nothing to hide.
p362_304|he added we are full of anger.
p362_305|he did it all for us.
p362_306|i don't think that is good enough.
p362_307|of course it is.
p362_308|we all make mistakes.
p362_309|it was published yesterday on the internet.
p362_310|that is my commitment.
p362_311|this is the only problem with the story.
p362_312|it is good football in scotland.
p362_313|knowledge is everything at this level.
p362_314|is that right?
p362_315|so other options had to be explored.
p362_316|they should be so lucky.
p362_317|he is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p362_318|it is good news for us.
p362_319|the timing is obvious.
p362_320|he's a good player but he's not the only one.
p362_321|thankfully that doesn't happen that often.
p362_322|i don't think it's very real.
p362_323|three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p362_324|i think she was right.
p362_325|is that what people want?
p362_326|christmas is special a time for reflection.
p362_327|i'd like to continue that record.
p362_328|it will be a new experience.
p362_329|the process itself has taken over.
p362_330|she asked for the appointment with me.
p362_331|the time commitment is the biggest thing.
p362_332|it is quite hard to track.
p362_333|it's not going to last five minutes.
p362_334|but his attendance is not guaranteed.
p362_335|surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p362_336|i am sure all schools would accept that.
p362_337|it was quite an ordeal for them.
p362_338|there are a number of possible outcomes.
p362_339|doesn't matter what you do.
p362_340|o no it's not
p362_341|the result could be all down to turnout.
p362_342|they are in good spirits.
p362_343|europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p362_344|he was their leader.
p362_345|the support of britain is assumed.
p362_346|so far he has not done so.
p362_347|maybe they will show it next year.
p362_348|they are a very good team.
p362_349|so there we are.
p362_350|and that is our first victory in edinburgh.
p362_351|it doesn't make me feel any better.
p362_352|the conversion didn't go over either.
p362_353|the incident is dead.
p362_354|we are delighted with the result.
p362_355|it will take time.
p362_356|they will do something big.
p362_357|the programme was awful.
p362_358|it is having a big impact.
p362_359|that is very hard alone.
p362_360|i am feeling on top of the world.
p362_361|doesn't he miss it?
p362_362|the same goes for russia.
p362_363|they went down together.
p362_364|cooking is intricate and complex.
p362_365|one the acute services trust will run the general hospital services.
p362_366|we were getting very worried.
p362_367|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p362_368|you can't really compare.
p362_369|we thought we were looking in good shape.
p362_370|plot is not the issue.
p362_371|we need to increase the membership.
p362_372|certainly there is much on the agenda.
p362_373|we should not be complacent.
p362_374|we all want the same things.
p362_375|maybe his time has gone.
p362_376|she died in hospital two hours later.
p362_377|thankfully mr campbell was able to help.
p362_378|so that is it for another year.
p362_379|the results are tragic.
p362_380|we are not getting him back.
p362_381|he was on a horse.
p362_382|both will be heard at glasgow sheriff court.
p362_383|i told her and she was extremely grateful.
p362_384|there may be reasons for it.
p362_385|he had taken everything from me.
p362_386|it's a good offer by any standards.
p362_387|yes it took time to recover.
p362_388|the potential is always in the idea.
p362_389|i am not a frustrated actor.
p362_390|no progress has been made.
p362_391|he can win every week.
p362_392|this makes up for it.
p362_393|my mind was made up.
p362_394|the plot is changing as time goes on.
p362_395|i never got anything out of it.
p362_396|it is patently true.
p362_397|locate in scotland also refused to comment.
p362_398|but don't just take my word for it.
p362_399|that is why he is so special.
p362_400|you hope he prevails.
p362_401|my mother was getting on at me.
p362_402|this is a very serious matter.
p362_403|it's going to be great
p362_404|that's a good sign.
p362_405|i'd never heard anything like it before.
p362_406|he added that he felt undermined.
p362_407|hopefully it will be good enough.
p362_408|he declined to be more specific.
p362_409|but it looks good for next year.
p362_410|figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p362_411|we want everyone to have a good time.
p362_412|we're going to rebuild.
p362_413|we are trying to do it properly.
p362_414|we actually had a laugh about that.
p362_415|it raises the edge.
p362_416|he is wanted by german police for questioning.
p362_417|i had no idea.
p362_418|as indeed it did.
p362_419|we made a world record together.
p362_420|they were outside the circle.
p362_421|i want to help other women.
p362_422|he got the part.
p362_423|or rather it isn't.
p362_424|he refused to name the survivors.
p363_001|please call stella.
p363_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p363_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p363_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p363_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p363_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p363_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p363_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p363_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p363_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p363_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p363_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p363_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p363_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p363_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p363_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p363_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p363_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p363_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p363_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p363_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p363_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p363_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p363_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p363_025|it's never been to committee.
p363_026|everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p363_027|it was actually very very difficult.
p363_028|the proposals were not new.
p363_029|he scored one goal and was on fire.
p363_030|his party never arrived.
p363_031|visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
p363_032|if that is the case it is a breakthrough.
p363_033|he gave no other details.
p363_034|it's not an improvement for him.
p363_035|i think it is wide open.
p363_036|it certainly is cause for concern.
p363_037|it's on with a roller.
p363_038|the captaincy will help that too.
p363_039|that's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p363_040|i think we're a long way forward.
p363_041|the impact was immediate.
p363_042|there is a new confidence about the club.
p363_043|his film is not.
p363_044|it is the strength of the school.
p363_045|in my experience he does not do that.
p363_046|that is good news.
p363_047|this has come as a shock to everyone.
p363_048|he will never be forgotten.
p363_049|i was not overly concerned about this.
p363_050|he was very grateful for his health.
p363_051|the nation has his music.
p363_052|but real life is not like that.
p363_053|so now we know.
p363_054|that is why this action has been taken.
p363_055|who will pay for this?
p363_056|the defender should have won the bloody ba.
p363_057|there has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
p363_058|we were upset about the referee.
p363_059|that is our objective.
p363_060|what's the problem?
p363_061|he is not alone.
p363_062|he did that last sunday.
p363_063|there wasn't anything in it.
p363_064|the club is afflicted by injuries.
p363_065|sentencing is also being considered in that review.
p363_066|lovely day isn't it?
p363_067|it was far from business as usual.
p363_068|thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p363_069|the show is not over.
p363_070|saddam hussein is a devil.
p363_071|this is a judgment issue.
p363_072|thirty people have applied for his job
p363_073|it was just an accident.
p363_074|we are not commenting at the moment.
p363_075|today we must not repeat that mistake.
p363_076|somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p363_077|he is slightly confused.
p363_078|we did not deserve to go through.
p363_079|the course has helped a lot.
p363_080|all the time that number was coming down and down.
p363_081|there is room for me.
p363_082|that can only be a good thing.
p363_083|i have never seen anything like this.
p363_084|they are difficult awards to decide.
p363_085|it was that kind of war.
p363_086|that is my preference.
p363_087|he later told the herald it is true.
p363_088|it has come a long way since then.
p363_089|it was decided he should be dismissed.
p363_090|but someone has got to do it.
p363_091|we have not given up.
p363_092|it was the turning point of the afternoon.
p363_093|i'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p363_094|what has happened?
p363_095|if they are not the commission will take action.
p363_096|where will the money come from?
p363_097|she is still very poorly.
p363_098|it was good fun.
p363_099|this is a great shame.
p363_100|we talk about effective military action.
p363_101|i can't get it.
p363_102|it was entirely justified.
p363_103|he demanded to speak to the boss.
p363_104|it's somewhere in between.
p363_105|the play was to go straight ahead.
p363_106|he had never run the distance before.
p363_107|i am the head.
p363_108|he is obviously very dangerous.
p363_109|it can be very worrying.
p363_110|it's harder believe me.
p363_111|we are making no comment.
p363_112|i sit at home a lot.
p363_113|that was certainly the case for the parties.
p363_114|i hope the couples are still together.
p363_115|we have learned a tremendous amount.
p363_116|but that is not enough.
p363_117|these people are helpless.
p363_118|i wish him well.
p363_119|only the details have to be sorted out.
p363_120|it would be really interesting if they did.
p363_121|that takes a lot of courage.
p363_122|sadly it is not to be.
p363_123|motorists will welcome this.
p363_124|i welcome this bill.
p363_125|this is not a problem.
p363_126|he announced his plans.
p363_127|he is the man to beat.
p363_128|we are getting not a penny.
p363_129|look at the turn out.
p363_130|which brings us to the question of money.
p363_131|it is very simple.
p363_132|there was something special about that.
p363_133|many other areas are coming up.
p363_134|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p363_135|there were no reports of casualties.
p363_136|but it's a subtle process.
p363_137|she didn't tell me anything the night before.
p363_138|i will be having talks with the workforce.
p363_139|changes need to be made.
p363_140|things are going well.
p363_141|hard it will be.
p363_142|i was deeply worried.
p363_143|maybe it will work there.
p363_144|how does it all work?
p363_145|we could easily have lost that game.
p363_146|there's a lot of it going on.
p363_147|i doubt it would be genuine.
p363_148|it would be a masterclass.
p363_149|it would have been a very explosive issue.
p363_150|i didn't really expect to be called up.
p363_151|they will not be going back.
p363_152|the progress has been steady.
p363_153|it has no chance.
p363_154|his body was never found.
p363_155|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p363_156|we have been extremely busy.
p363_157|it appears to have been successful.
p363_158|this is a big game for them.
p363_159|we still have to wait for that.
p363_160|he said it was his greatest work.
p363_161|i feel a little betrayed.
p363_162|the baby deserves the credit.
p363_163|i live for today.
p363_164|i have been very stupid.
p363_165|i always savour the company of the voice.
p363_166|my father and mother are.
p363_167|but that was his nature.
p363_168|we have been together for five years.
p363_169|they would never let him go.
p363_170|so what's in store?
p363_171|he didn't know where to look.
p363_172|the german had a point to make.
p363_173|there are two characters.
p363_174|the only trouble is finding them.
p363_175|scotland won by six wickets.
p363_176|her body has never been found.
p363_177|it is all credit to them today.
p363_178|that was a huge experience.
p363_179|perhaps it was just as well.
p363_180|will he be here for the weekend?
p363_181|he can do everything.
p363_182|now is the time for action.
p363_183|public safety is paramount.
p363_184|i feel really confident in that department.
p363_185|they were not consulted.
p363_186|he had an apartment ready.
p363_187|the prime minister will make the decision.
p363_188|there's only one word for it.
p363_189|we're trying to get rounded performers.
p363_190|it was far more important than that.
p363_191|that is european law.
p363_192|gary parker is a favourite of mine.
p363_193|their appeal will be heard this week.
p363_194|their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p363_195|why is he not fighting for the union?
p363_196|a decision is expected tomorrow.
p363_197|i wanted to get on with it.
p363_198|i don't think it's the area.
p363_199|well you might have a point.
p363_200|it was a horrible moment.
p363_201|it was quite distressing for the crew.
p363_202|tomorrow we begin again as new yorkers.
p363_203|i really had to concentrate.
p363_204|we didn't want any trouble.
p363_205|frankly they have to crack down.
p363_206|the training will take place in downing street.
p363_207|we have still got the fight in us.
p363_208|that decision is now being appealed.
p363_209|this is really good news for us.
p363_210|i wanted to have a go.
p363_211|a senior party insider said.
p363_212|we got on very well.
p363_213|i think it must be the uniforms.
p363_214|this is not a monument to the past.
p363_215|we can all understand that.
p363_216|you are going to have to do it.
p363_217|i was amazed at her knowledge.
p363_218|where is the evidence?
p363_219|it was important in training terms.
p363_220|ours is on for two days.
p363_221|we don't want that at all.
p363_222|her appeal is to be heard this week.
p363_223|the group will report back in the summer.
p363_224|among them is his beloved teacher.
p363_225|we don't come here for our health.
p363_226|that in itself is a joke.
p363_227|they know nothing about the sport.
p363_228|but we shall have to talk to him.
p363_229|well we know now.
p363_230|he was only doing his job.
p363_231|they chose the latter.
p363_232|the legal process could last weeks.
p363_233|all were later allowed home.
p363_234|i can do this on my own.
p363_235|will you just put it away?
p363_236|i think it's more important to have fun.
p363_237|by then it was too late.
p363_238|i am very sorry to hear about this.
p363_239|i'm so looking forward to it.
p363_240|i think we can do well.
p363_241|that ignorance is crucial.
p363_242|it was an excellent performance.
p363_243|it is also claimed that he was murdered.
p363_244|clearly there was a mix up.
p363_245|i have not had much of him.
p363_246|sub not used mackay.
p363_247|we are taking no chances this time.
p363_248|he is to be commended.
p363_249|i can hardly believe it.
p363_250|the goals will come.
p363_251|i don't feel like working.
p363_252|then one day it happened.
p363_253|i sit in the car.
p363_254|we stopped at half time.
p363_255|i was brought up in a mining background.
p363_256|all winners should be tested.
p363_257|we would like to see them in court.
p363_258|i thought his speech was a disgrace.
p363_259|it is not a soap opera.
p363_260|whatever we do we know we can do well.
p363_261|they may not always be so lucky.
p363_262|where was the point in all this?
p363_263|he was travelling to see his daughter.
p363_264|it's an hour of the same response.
p363_265|this is the root of their problems.
p363_266|two other men have recovered.
p363_267|it will be a challenging film.
p363_268|the test case is still awaiting action.
p363_269|she is under police escort.
p363_270|however that is not in itself enough.
p363_271|that should not be their conclusion.
p363_272|we're going to fight it.
p363_273|the plot is minimal.
p363_274|his funeral is not expected until next week.
p363_275|now we have had enough.
p363_276|can you believe it?
p363_277|he is certainly not looking for another job.
p363_278|i have a problem with these things.
p363_280|the gap is closing.
p363_281|then there was her childhood.
p363_282|other people had looked at it.
p363_283|and the other winners are.
p363_284|it was quite a sight.
p363_285|but he was far from alone.
p363_286|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p363_287|i believe he could have turned it around.
p363_288|the believer isn't just a movie.
p363_289|you are looking at him.
p363_290|the best team won.
p363_291|it being the weekend there was no one there.
p363_292|it was an achievement all right.
p363_293|they think that it matters but it doesn't.
p363_294|he was pronounced dead in hospital.
p363_295|it should be equal.
p363_296|it will make a big difference.
p363_297|i want to make a difference.
p363_298|what was the cause of all this outrage?
p363_299|he will have it within two weeks.
p363_300|how do you feel?
p363_301|it is a terrible state of affairs.
p363_302|it was not the right time for me.
p363_303|but they have the sound.
p363_304|not all women are dismayed.
p363_305|there will have to be a full inquiry.
p363_306|it is not just in edinburgh.
p363_307|it's never happened before.
p363_308|it was a deeper deception.
p363_309|norton was delighted with his successes.
p363_310|the figures are bad but not that bad.
p363_311|there is another side to it.
p363_312|his remit is specific.
p363_313|it will be very damaging for research.
p363_314|i'm a bit overwhelmed.
p363_315|the old firm are growing.
p363_316|they want to win the title.
p363_317|her concerns were not without foundation.
p363_318|this decision is a farce.
p363_319|that would be the constructive way forward.
p363_320|my view has now completely changed.
p363_321|it was blown out of proportion.
p363_322|you have no chance of planning permission.
p363_323|that is taking place in strathclyde.
p363_324|he was in a mood.
p363_325|was this element always there?
p363_326|this is an awful lot of money.
p363_327|he was the architect.
p363_328|the united nations must act.
p363_329|they haven't got a hope.
p363_330|he was a national treasure.
p363_331|i think they are right to be impatient.
p363_332|we need to regroup.
p363_333|i must make that clear.
p363_334|the board is currently resolving its differences.
p363_335|i've never regretted coming here.
p363_336|he is in a lot of pain it is very distressing.
p363_337|i just had to go for it.
p363_338|it seems to go down well.
p363_339|i am feeling on top of the world.
p363_341|i don't know really.
p363_343|therefore there is a threat.
p363_344|she would love it.
p363_345|one was taken to hospital.
p363_346|you did not see it.
p363_347|gritty he did not want.
p363_348|the world is being invited to visit.
p363_349|nobody was able to escape.
p363_350|surely the answer is yes.
p363_351|secondly there is the question of money.
p363_352|he was later deported.
p363_353|i only found out about it this morning.
p363_354|i am not sure.
p363_355|one might think that it is a power.
p363_356|this place is outstanding.
p363_357|obviously we want to stop the rot.
p363_358|but it is a fact.
p363_359|they never seem to do anything about it.
p363_360|we're going to sleep.
p363_361|it raises a serious question mark.
p363_362|the work with alison was a great experience.
p363_363|it was great fun.
p363_364|experience in this work is paramount.
p363_365|it has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p363_366|it is not needed it should go.
p363_367|she had not suffered any physical injury.
p363_368|we have a business to run.
p363_369|we have been overwhelmed by the response.
p363_370|and there are others.
p363_371|however it was well worth the wait.
p363_372|i think we did well.
p363_373|only two things are certain.
p363_374|there is nothing to fear.
p363_375|just look at his record.
p363_376|he was a legend.
p363_377|it is a memorial.
p363_378|i have no evidence.
p363_379|but is he?
p363_380|we were very unhappy with the incident.
p363_381|the challenge is to win a cup.
p363_382|it is something that we would support.
p363_383|it was a double tragedy for the family.
p363_384|we are in shock.
p363_385|does it really matter?
p363_386|i loved it and so did my friend.
p363_387|a decision is expected today.
p363_388|i am enjoying it.
p363_389|it wasn't very pretty to watch.
p363_390|you have to go for it.
p363_391|are these immoral?
p363_392|it has been a massive success.
p363_393|it is for the same reason.
p363_394|the whole thing has been a nightmare.
p363_395|players are fighting to stay in the team.
p363_396|he will have something to say.
p363_397|you can't take a chance.
p363_398|i'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p363_399|there is a lack of logic.
p363_401|we are about to have our own parliament.
p363_402|i am desperate to play for scotland.
p363_403|it is a large number.
p363_404|she doesn't know where to begin.
p363_405|this is your chance.
p363_406|i'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
p363_407|there's nothing she can't do.
p363_408|nicolson is no stranger to the highlands.
p363_409|i'd love the chance to play for scotland.
p363_410|clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p363_411|he died in september.
p363_412|it was not even this century.
p363_413|that was really tough.
p363_414|it's not going to last five minutes.
p363_415|i am happy with my form.
p363_416|that's the name of the game though.
p363_417|with him are the symbols of his faith.
p363_418|overall it has certainly worked out.
p363_419|this is actually true.
p363_420|both were reduced to rubble.
p363_421|it could have taken another two months.
p363_422|hopefully the answer is in the positive.
p363_423|he said he had no reports of casualties.
p364_001|please call stella.
p364_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p364_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p364_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p364_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p364_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p364_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p364_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p364_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p364_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p364_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p364_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p364_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p364_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p364_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p364_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p364_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p364_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p364_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p364_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p364_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p364_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p364_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p364_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p364_025|is that not pathetic?
p364_026|our nation has been changed by this event.
p364_027|that would be a big step forward.
p364_028|i love you so very much.
p364_029|scotland needs to hear it too.
p364_030|prime minister blair is not that way.
p364_031|but at the moment there isn't the budget.
p364_032|it is not a matter of concern.
p364_033|we're not either of those things.
p364_034|the man has already had too many chances.
p364_035|it shouldn't be a problem.
p364_036|it was very moving actually.
p364_037|it isn't a free for all.
p364_038|pensions have been hitting the headlines.
p364_039|i was not fit enough and it showed.
p364_040|i thought it was the only way out.
p364_041|we welcome the ministers decision.
p364_042|since then it has become a tradition.
p364_043|the concept is simple.
p364_044|that is how the farmer is feeling today.
p364_045|and that's the trouble with this business.
p364_046|so what did he do?
p364_047|we must not give in to bastards.
p364_048|the trial will open today.
p364_049|but it didn't happen.
p364_050|what do you think they said?
p364_051|there will be no disruption in the schools.
p364_053|i can live with that.
p364_054|there is no doubt about that.
p364_055|the president took offence.
p364_056|our commitment is to move forward.
p364_057|partly it is his own fault.
p364_058|that's where it all started.
p364_059|the family is so happy for him.
p364_060|why has it taken so long?
p364_061|no one knows the numbers.
p364_062|you make the choice.
p364_063|it is not the fault of one man of course.
p364_064|i knew the script.
p364_065|it's not going to work.
p364_066|he leaves a beat.
p364_067|perhaps it was her demeanour.
p364_068|i see no need to change.
p364_069|it lasted longer than we thought.
p364_070|they've got more time.
p364_071|they made a huge impression on me.
p364_072|there is no hiding place.
p364_073|a contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p364_074|this was a massive result for us.
p364_075|it's not in my nature.
p364_076|you see this business is a good one.
p364_077|who is he?
p364_078|scotland were on saturday.
p364_079|he wanted to talk to me about it.
p364_081|that would be a big mistake.
p364_082|no one has spoken to me.
p364_083|his arrival could be the making of them.
p364_084|i was close enough.
p364_085|he dismissed the action.
p364_086|i said how much?
p364_087|i support the stand that they are making.
p364_088|the couple had one daughter.
p364_089|but was it really so big?
p364_090|nature will not find its own level.
p364_091|i didn't have the choice.
p364_092|but this has already been rejected.
p364_094|they have not seen her for years.
p364_095|it was good to score the goal today.
p364_096|allison is not convinced.
p364_097|he felt there was no case to answer.
p364_098|this is a one off.
p364_099|he liked to talk.
p364_100|lots of others were doing the same.
p364_101|it is still holding good today.
p364_102|this takes the pressure off.
p364_103|our legal advice is clear.
p364_104|but he has a lifeline.
p364_105|this is a horrible loss.
p364_106|long term it was the right thing to do.
p364_107|we are not leaving the area.
p364_108|the airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p364_109|success in scotland is important.
p364_110|we could do a lot worse.
p364_111|i know the worry over iraq.
p364_112|the outcome is now in our own hands.
p364_113|it was just great.
p364_114|you are always aware of the injury potential.
p364_115|we don't know what is happening to them.
p364_116|it's an old story.
p364_117|it was an important part of the course.
p364_118|it has been a great success.
p364_119|i will be trying to do better tomorrow.
p364_120|who will take them after that?
p364_121|it is part of their job.
p364_122|this decision is a victory for common sense.
p364_123|one is too many.
p364_124|what can you say?
p364_125|this means that our programme is quite unusual.
p364_126|the money all appears to be gone.
p364_127|he was extremely ill.
p364_128|this time it was not be.
p364_129|they are unable to say anything.
p364_130|the timing is wrong.
p364_131|that's why he is a national treasure.
p364_132|he just attracted people.
p364_133|he will be fine.
p364_134|i love a clever reader.
p364_135|there will be no exceptions to this rule.
p364_136|but he's a very quiet man.
p364_137|destruction came from within.
p364_138|it's not their fault.
p364_140|it won the match.
p364_141|new investment will be openly tendered.
p364_142|i'd never have called a doctor for myself.
p364_143|it is sponsored by the herald.
p364_144|i don't entirely buy that.
p364_145|it was the rugby writers dinner in london.
p364_146|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p364_147|i would say so.
p364_148|i've had six days of rehearsal.
p364_149|it's a good story.
p364_150|do not listen to them.
p364_151|it was too soon.
p364_152|it is an absolute disgrace.
p364_153|i don't think it is the case.
p364_154|everyone would have been happy.
p364_155|it has paid off.
p364_156|ferguson had done his homework.
p364_157|he deserved that much.
p364_158|we want to know about the policy.
p364_159|mr blair defended his wife.
p364_160|he has gone back to school.
p364_161|it is not illegal.
p364_162|i don't know where it went.
p364_163|there was nothing anyone could do.
p364_164|i don't want to use the term.
p364_165|i really feel sorry for the irish.
p364_166|now they have to do something about it.
p364_167|the post will be unpaid.
p364_168|one third of the places are already taken.
p364_169|i hope that doesn't happen.
p364_170|it's all happening at a local level.
p364_171|you will never replace the child.
p364_172|we must do that.
p364_173|england will be under a lot of pressure.
p364_174|this has been fantastic.
p364_175|i'm delighted for the lads.
p364_176|i learned that only yesterday.
p364_177|it's very very frustrating.
p364_178|we want him to continue that way.
p364_179|but he did not rule out further talks.
p364_180|our children are our future.
p364_181|it's part of your life.
p364_182|we will see how he is.
p364_183|he had a horror.
p364_184|so it was in politics.
p364_185|there are two offerings from scotland.
p364_187|the matter has been reported to the police.
p364_188|we are at war.
p364_189|we do know the reaction of the sac.
p364_190|the state is controlled by the left.
p364_191|the principle is quite clear.
p364_192|despite that it was a great day for me.
p364_193|i would say the risk is very small.
p364_194|and there are different perspectives.
p364_195|mr wallace was unimpressed.
p364_196|i put the drawing down.
p364_197|the hearing continues today.
p364_198|you would be wrong.
p364_199|on recent evidence he will not be missed.
p364_200|police have refused to name the couple involved.
p364_201|our destiny is in our own hands.
p364_202|the attitude was good today.
p364_203|i've got nothing to say.
p364_204|it requires a wider team.
p364_205|it is so beautiful.
p364_206|it is suitable and sensible.
p364_207|in many ways it was disastrous.
p364_208|i am really really happy.
p364_209|this is perfectly legal.
p364_210|i'm not interested in money.
p364_211|i'm looking forward to racing donovan.
p364_212|i can handle the pace.
p364_213|i am happy to be here.
p364_214|we are seeking a meeting with the minister.
p364_215|i believe it would have been successful.
p364_216|it's better to be happy.
p364_217|it's happened but it's a dream.
p364_218|i had a son.
p364_219|it was very very frightening.
p364_220|that suggests that out fitness is good.
p364_221|i had no choice.
p364_222|what do you do.
p364_223|it would also delay the scottish results.
p364_224|this one would have been.
p364_225|we just have to improve.
p364_226|it hasn't worked out that way.
p364_227|this is very good news.
p364_228|is it a warning to parents?
p364_229|everything is surrounded by confusion.
p364_230|there is nothing wrong with that.
p364_231|i could not believe the results.
p364_232|what do you do?
p364_233|and there are some interesting conductors too.
p364_234|it was all over for us then.
p364_235|they were assured that it would.
p364_236|thankfully they liked it.
p364_237|i am very encouraged by this poll.
p364_238|we just do not do it.
p364_239|it was a long time coming.
p364_240|it had happened to him.
p364_241|that is our business.
p364_242|we were completely outplayed.
p364_243|the car driver was not injured.
p364_244|it was a surprising decision.
p364_245|colin cameron was excellent.
p364_246|i believe in having difficult times.
p364_247|stand by for action.
p364_248|it was something special.
p364_249|he deserves a top team.
p364_250|we just need the government to act.
p364_251|it was really surprising.
p364_252|it was a nightmare.
p364_253|but this is just the first step.
p364_254|we can do it.
p364_255|this is as bad as it gets.
p364_256|the real issue is personal.
p364_257|that can happen so easily.
p364_258|we deserved to get the victory today.
p364_259|that's the last thing he will do.
p364_260|first we had the battle of britain.
p364_261|it does not take much.
p364_262|it would be a bonus for this game.
p364_263|i've seen it work already.
p364_264|do you mean today?
p364_265|israeli forces denied the claim.
p364_266|this could be the case.
p364_267|we try to keep it right.
p364_268|i have got to keep the lid on.
p364_269|or so we thought.
p364_270|for many it had become a fact of life.
p364_271|last season was very hard for me.
p364_272|it was a definite penalty.
p364_273|it's great fun to get to act.
p364_274|we are keen to have him back.
p364_275|horses have some sense.
p364_276|it goes in cycles.
p364_277|and now he has decided enough.
p364_278|visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
p364_279|he made no comment.
p364_280|we have to get on with it.
p364_281|he was at the game and he is indeed.
p364_282|it would be dangerous to resign.
p364_283|it is a victory to that extent.
p364_284|clearly the future remains uncertain.
p364_285|i certainly hope so.
p364_286|she died later on monday.
p364_287|it does and it doesn't.
p364_288|it will not be today though.
p364_289|we suspect he was pleased.
p364_290|i have been here for only three months.
p364_291|we have no knowledge of this.
p364_292|i was the willing journeyman.
p364_293|i know we ask a lot of you.
p364_294|when he got up he was hit again.
p364_297|it was just one man.
p364_298|it's going to be tough.
p364_299|you will be very very welcome.
p364_300|i really want to win in glasgow.
p364_301|is he any good?
p364_302|the proposals have been taken out of context.
p364_303|it was then that rangers scored.
p364_304|this was repeated the second time.
p364_305|i chose the former.
p364_306|sub not used mckee.
p364_308|they were very responsive.
p364_309|we're talking to him.
p374_001|please call stella.
p374_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p374_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p374_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p374_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p374_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p374_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p374_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p374_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p374_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p374_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p374_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p374_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p374_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p374_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p374_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p374_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p374_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p374_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p374_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p374_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p374_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p374_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p374_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p374_025|she had to learn a new discipline.
p374_026|this isn't some form of commission.
p374_027|the game today is certainly different.
p374_028|we did it in one take.
p374_029|i'll take the blame for that.
p374_030|and that was just for starters.
p374_031|in order to get there we have got to invest.
p374_032|why did it take a concerted campaign?
p374_033|i will always remember the horrible images.
p374_034|what you sow you have to reap.
p374_035|we are expecting a big crowd.
p374_036|i was contacted this morning.
p374_037|he didn't want me to leave the house.
p374_038|it's not just a challenge for us.
p374_039|but honestly there is no need for us to panic.
p374_040|i've had a ball.
p374_041|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p374_042|you thought it was a headache.
p374_043|i still hope to go.
p374_044|does that put pressure on us?
p374_045|as a player you have to move on.
p374_046|it is so out of character.
p374_047|i am inclined to play it down.
p374_048|however it's good to turn the page.
p374_049|his condition was serious but stable.
p374_050|he had reason to be pleased.
p374_051|we have a problem.
p374_052|i find it puzzling and disturbing.
p374_053|that alibi is now gone.
p374_054|but the cost to his health was enormous.
p374_055|i suspect the latter.
p374_056|however in orkney there was a mixed response.
p374_057|it is simple really.
p374_058|the net is closing.
p374_059|i cannot believe she has been admonished.
p374_060|that took a long time to happen.
p374_061|it was on fire.
p374_062|this year the exercise is being repeated.
p374_063|nobody did in those days.
p374_064|you the british people are the boss.
p374_065|where is the discipline?
p374_066|we were very much a happy family.
p374_067|they won the trophy in the hoops.
p374_068|this time it is official.
p374_069|it's going to be epic.
p374_070|she could easily have been killed.
p374_071|yesterday one from aberdeen was postponed.
p374_072|i didn't mean to kill her.
p374_073|we're just a family working hard working seven days a week.
p374_074|that money could have been coming to scotland.
p374_075|i'd love to do another olympics.
p374_076|what method of funding is being used?
p374_077|it is not a standing army.
p374_078|this is a great day.
p374_079|he got his degree.
p374_080|i'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p374_081|and their remit is limited.
p374_082|i have great respect for all my players.
p374_083|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p374_084|there is no question of dithering.
p374_085|his track record is not promising.
p374_086|edinburgh in fact was not included in the survey.
p374_087|it would be very dangerous.
p374_088|now it has been eclipsed.
p374_089|our numbers are small.
p374_090|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p374_091|i am confident of the outcome this week.
p374_092|it's not right of labour.
p374_093|it doesn't always work that way.
p374_094|this was much worse.
p374_095|that though is not true.
p374_096|i'm working at the moment.
p374_097|however this is only the start.
p374_098|they might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p374_099|he loved it and so did they.
p374_100|i want to be there by right.
p374_101|that was very important.
p374_102|two and a half million people have died.
p374_103|i hope they understand that.
p374_104|sadly it took a tragedy to change things.
p374_105|it's a very very special day.
p374_106|let that be their memorial.
p374_107|we're all paying for it.
p374_108|lester was like that.
p374_109|of course we know them from their work in the theatre.
p374_110|that is very very bad news for our nation.
p374_111|we were never told it was already decided.
p374_112|it was a sickening sight.
p374_113|we are at an advanced stage and are now instructing counsel.
p374_114|i don't think it would make any difference.
p374_115|they have just got to believe in themselves.
p374_116|if that is not a warning what is it?
p374_117|i fell in love with it.
p374_118|it ignores the future.
p374_119|the quality of work is very impressive.
p374_120|that's not going to happen again.
p374_121|paterson was the man.
p374_122|the course is in great condition.
p374_123|pitt of course would play the lead singer.
p374_124|it is too early to speculate.
p374_125|it's up to them.
p374_126|they went to the press.
p374_127|i am happy to play for aberdeen.
p374_128|we are very pleased.
p374_129|you're not going to get hurt.
p374_130|the arrow was aimed at the heart.
p374_131|i was very fortunate.
p374_132|it had been in place since last july.
p374_133|players want to know what is on offer.
p374_134|they are a good team.
p374_135|the contest was already over.
p374_136|does it make a profit?
p374_137|now that would impress the kids.
p374_138|it was the only possible decision.
p374_139|how much of a cop out is that?
p374_140|the whole region is in shock.
p374_141|where is the logic in that?
p374_142|i was a spectator that is as far as it goes.
p374_143|i told the players that at half time.
p374_144|i see the extended family once a year.
p374_145|why is this?
p374_146|it was indeed a night to remember.
p374_147|raymond was always on the outside.
p374_148|there is something in this.
p374_149|and so it should.
p374_150|news of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p374_151|they may differ on other issues.
p374_152|that's the important thing.
p374_153|but opinion was divided.
p374_154|next league matches motherwell.
p374_155|i have been there already.
p374_156|my wife is totally behind me on this.
p374_157|scott and emily were so happy.
p374_158|sub not used mcculloch.
p374_159|but every two minutes it was exploding.
p374_160|and sooner than we may think.
p374_161|it is a step up.
p374_162|you probably have never seen them before.
p374_163|however it is not all bad news for women.
p374_164|we're very proud of him and his achievement.
p374_165|something has got to change.
p374_166|i made a mistake.
p374_167|i'd never given up on myself.
p374_168|that prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p374_169|that's the kind of production it was.
p374_170|little girls are his victims.
p374_171|it is not for me though.
p374_172|councillor gordon has refused to stand down.
p374_173|the rest is his own.
p374_174|the statement was a lie.
p374_175|it is the manager's decision.
p374_176|it was a day for records.
p374_177|the government has to grasp the nettle.
p374_178|there's no reason for panic.
p374_179|we have got away with it.
p374_180|however the referee was not in the giving vein.
p374_181|i was doing well at the hustings.
p374_182|he had planned to sell it.
p374_183|it was just one of those days.
p374_184|but it did not last.
p374_185|she has been unable to work since.
p374_186|no one has ever seen inside.
p374_187|i know nothing about that.
p374_188|we have not given up.
p374_189|archer is no newcomer to the stage.
p374_190|it's a matter of time.
p374_191|the number never came.
p374_192|you encourage them you can do it.
p374_193|the winner will be announced by early summer.
p374_194|this is the new edinburgh.
p374_195|the stadium was full.
p374_196|there isn't much of a scene in austria.
p374_197|perhaps it is jealousy.
p374_198|his name is michael owen.
p374_199|surely if anything it would be the other way round.
p374_200|i didn't want to ignore the punters.
p374_201|this hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p374_202|i foolishly had done nothing about it.
p374_203|again this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p374_204|it was so unfair.
p374_205|smith has not let him down.
p374_206|they have to be dealt with.
p374_207|glasgow is a friendly city.
p374_208|no it's actually in a block of flats.
p374_209|they were that poor.
p374_210|it was an odd affair in many respects.
p374_211|stan is a vital part of our future.
p374_212|we're very close to being a good team.
p374_213|all these things have an impact.
p374_214|i thought their commitment was superb.
p374_215|i'm really proud of my young players.
p374_216|there was great support all round the route.
p374_217|i had nothing to lose.
p374_218|that is just not true.
p374_219|history is made at the masters.
p374_220|this is not a european army.
p374_221|not so he insisted.
p374_222|all of the names are familiar to me.
p374_223|i wonder what they listen to?
p374_224|does a lot of drawing.
p374_225|a contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p374_226|there are moments of honesty too.
p374_227|he is doing just that.
p374_228|the night is young.
p374_229|that is bad enough.
p374_230|we used to keep our business rates.
p374_231|i suspect that it will.
p374_232|we need to think.
p374_233|we are very happy with the verdict.
p374_234|they want it to work.
p374_235|for once it wasn't about money.
p374_236|it's not the end of the matter of course.
p374_237|that doesn't happen in europe.
p374_238|jackson may well be right.
p374_239|then it was the turn of the carnival.
p374_240|he's very very lucky to be alive.
p374_241|it's always somebody else's.
p374_242|it could now be up to the courts.
p374_243|we can make a difference.
p374_244|this was not a contest.
p374_245|it is just so sad.
p374_246|meanwhile the business of government goes on.
p374_247|this was not an easy meeting for me.
p374_248|it all depends on the chancellor.
p374_249|i get very excited by that.
p374_250|the members have clearly spoken.
p374_251|it was not pretty.
p374_252|it was like a scene from the holocaust.
p374_253|which means it matters.
p374_254|this is certainly not the case.
p374_255|there is great potential on this river.
p374_256|it's very difficult to find a buyer.
p374_257|our thoughts are with his family.
p374_258|it is a technique.
p374_259|the court has not decided.
p374_260|i feel sorry for the reds.
p374_261|i just want to get rid of it.
p374_262|i have not come in to take over.
p374_263|is this accurate?
p374_264|but what did it matter?
p374_265|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p374_266|i am expecting to win.
p374_267|it used to bother me sometimes but it doesn't any more.
p374_268|i was an athlete.
p374_269|we don't need to change the law.
p374_270|all of us do.
p374_271|three months or so later they are returning.
p374_272|that is partly true but there are ways of doing it.
p374_273|we can only do that for so long.
p374_274|he got very close tonight.
p374_275|i don't know why you say goodbye.
p374_276|it is our other home.
p374_277|where do you start?
p374_278|at the end of the day two men have been shot.
p374_279|it was the first time they met.
p374_280|i am also delighted for all the players.
p374_281|we are delighted with that.
p374_282|he did very well but didn't win.
p374_283|and we're not there yet.
p374_284|people don't feel safe including me.
p374_285|later we discovered it was a hoax.
p374_286|they want to shut the scottish office.
p374_287|it is something that we will put right.
p374_288|i had a good life at rangers.
p374_289|perhaps we should do the same.
p374_290|he's very good at relating to adults.
p374_291|it opened last month.
p374_292|just a year later he was dead.
p374_293|you must be ready to play anyone.
p374_294|this is a club on the rise.
p374_295|i had a sense of deja vu.
p374_296|that was the theory anyway.
p374_297|i don't know them or anything.
p374_298|i couldn't make out what was going on.
p374_299|that's what we're trying to achieve.
p374_300|because we do not need it.
p374_301|the atmosphere is businesslike.
p374_302|they use them for everything.
p374_303|i've already got this.
p374_304|there's a story too.
p374_305|there have been different reports from different people.
p374_306|but it has all been worthwhile.
p374_307|but that's another story for another day.
p374_308|it was a foolhardy decision.
p374_309|this is as bad as it can get.
p374_310|and also whatever he does can he really win?
p374_311|it was just awful.
p374_312|there was a hell of a row.
p374_313|we are satisfied with this outcome.
p374_314|i am not a threat to coaches.
p374_315|it's never over until it's over.
p374_316|he had been a singer.
p374_317|i was very pleased with them today though.
p374_318|if you're going to do it do it right.
p374_319|we should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p374_320|no one was listening.
p374_321|it's not one for the purists.
p374_322|it may now be too expensive for anyone.
p374_323|it really is good to be back.
p374_324|we did discuss the lockerbie issue.
p374_325|it will never happen.
p374_326|we cannot go on like this.
p374_327|the biggest thing is structure.
p374_328|this could be a recipe for conflict.
p374_329|this is great news for us.
p374_330|we certainly have to try something.
p374_331|so now we know the secret.
p374_332|harrowing is easy after all.
p374_333|what is that?
p374_334|we just want them home.
p374_335|and we have beaten them before.
p374_336|he has two children.
p374_337|that is the fact of the matter.
p374_338|it was a matter of choice.
p374_339|and that's good news for the magpies.
p374_340|but we can't have a casino.
p374_341|i'm looking forward to that.
p374_342|so what is their secret?
p374_343|it's a great idea.
p374_344|it was not being marketed properly.
p374_345|i have been struggling with my form.
p374_346|that was about it.
p374_347|it is coming on very well.
p374_348|we won't go down without a struggle.
p374_349|by hard work is the answer.
p374_350|we were unlucky not to score.
p374_351|i did not have a bet on myself.
p374_352|as if they ever stopped.
p374_353|and that brings us to the point.
p374_354|clark is back on top form.
p374_355|but happily the story is true.
p374_356|it does seem a mystery.
p374_357|scottish women appear at eden court inverness tonight.
p374_358|it's for that reason he should resign.
p374_359|it's a good start.
p374_360|one person had a broken back.
p374_361|i hope that is the lucky break.
p374_362|it is almost like a family.
p374_363|but when we do it is great.
p374_364|i disagree entirely with the decision.
p374_365|my game is coming back.
p374_366|it was a game they could have won.
p374_367|then came the collision with sergio.
p374_368|it is a matter for westminster.
p374_369|and we know that because we know the hairdresser.
p374_370|i can't believe the buzz.
p374_371|sport is good for you.
p374_372|i am delighted for everyone in airdrie.
p374_373|this is not a struggle against islam.
p374_374|this is the goal.
p374_375|the mood was euphoric.
p374_376|i want to get at the truth.
p374_377|everyone here is very sad.
p374_378|it was located on the remote control.
p374_379|i am not changing my mind.
p374_380|is something which we just don't do.
p374_381|he was taken ill in his office.
p374_382|it is though the law is not clear cut.
p374_383|it's the only thing.
p374_384|two others were also seriously injured.
p374_385|what's the best thing to do?
p374_386|for tragedy it is.
p374_387|i'm trying to stay open on that.
p374_388|next league matches motherwell dundee united.
p374_389|it was good today.
p374_390|we are all very pleased.
p374_391|the hotel was huge.
p374_392|these days are over.
p374_393|they do it properly.
p374_394|well you can have a tree.
p374_395|i just don't know what she was doing.
p374_396|however there was hope and glory too for scotland.
p374_397|you can't have both.
p374_398|that's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p374_399|i was influenced by all of these things.
p374_400|you do not change overnight.
p374_401|or so it seemed.
p374_402|i will have to think about it.
p374_403|he suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p374_404|well you can't have everything.
p374_405|they have not given them the evidence.
p374_406|we need to chat.
p374_407|we are obviously disturbed by this case.
p374_408|that was never their agenda.
p374_409|i certainly will not settle.
p374_410|he said it was the worst possible result.
p374_411|it's very tragic and traumatic.
p374_412|it's always the same isn't it?
p374_413|i don't make it mystical.
p374_414|so what was he really doing?
p374_415|neither could be contacted last night.
p374_416|that clearly wasn't what they wanted.
p374_417|some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p374_418|and well he might.
p374_419|they have not been named.
p374_420|it feels like too much.
p374_421|this is the last thing we ever expected.
p374_422|next year this time we will be home.
p374_423|that time has passed.
p374_424|it will be crucial.
p376_001|please call stella.
p376_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p376_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p376_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p376_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p376_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p376_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p376_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p376_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p376_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p376_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p376_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p376_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p376_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p376_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p376_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p376_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p376_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p376_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p376_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p376_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p376_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p376_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p376_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p376_025|it's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p376_026|but it failed.
p376_027|he said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p376_028|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p376_029|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p376_030|suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p376_031|so if we can take anything from tonight it will be fantastic.
p376_032|we want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p376_033|because we do not need it.
p376_034|it's a matter of balance.
p376_035|and we have a singer.
p376_036|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p376_037|he has not been named.
p376_038|it is a matter of the utmost concern to the allies.
p376_039|they have now been banned from celtic park for life.
p376_040|it was clear.
p376_041|it is urgent.
p376_042|a neighbour said.
p376_043|we need to chat.
p376_044|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p376_045|it's the same old story.
p376_046|that should do it.
p376_048|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p376_049|a recording contract is on the horizon.
p376_050|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p376_051|he looks like an afghan.
p376_052|they had to explain it.
p376_053|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p376_054|but the law is very clear on this.
p376_055|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p376_056|next league matches celtic.
p376_057|sadly it can't.
p376_058|this is a step backwards.
p376_059|it will take time.
p376_060|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p376_061|four other charges were dropped.
p376_063|art is extra.
p376_064|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p376_065|an appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p376_066|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p376_067|we should have known.
p376_068|it should be devolved.
p376_069|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p376_070|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p376_071|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p376_072|the price cuts are really exciting.
p376_073|neither it is.
p376_074|she died in hospital two hours later.
p376_075|it is a job creation scheme.
p376_076|everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p376_077|this is the way things should be handled.
p376_078|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p376_079|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p376_080|nothing is yet confirmed.
p376_081|no progress has been made.
p376_082|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p376_083|they lived for their children.
p376_084|that will come after the game on saturday.
p376_085|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p376_086|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p376_087|she told the herald.
p376_088|then came the crunch.
p376_089|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p376_090|i love the dome.
p376_091|we have always maintained that we would never abandon scottish football.
p376_092|they are now divorced.
p376_093|scotland will have strong defences as part of the united kingdom.
p376_094|the selection process is still at a very early stage.
p376_095|previously they were raised in the european court of human rights.
p376_096|it was mayhem.
p376_097|but it was a pleasure.
p376_098|we live by the rule of law.
p376_099|meanwhile the scottish consumer council yesterday offered support for the new bill.
p376_100|we recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p376_101|oil embargo endorsed.
p376_102|he takes the job.
p376_103|according to the criteria he is qualified for scotland.
p376_104|it's not a new concept in jazz.
p376_105|i'm so angry.
p376_106|the fire was above the hole.
p376_107|we are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p376_108|maybe this battle has been.
p376_109|but the fans deserve to know
p376_110|it is rubbish.
p376_111|who would be a referee?
p376_112|this is the first big idea of the scottish parliament election.
p376_113|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p376_114|it is a delight on every level.
p376_115|here again they were denied a voice.
p376_116|she has been shot.
p376_117|it is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p376_118|wednesday night was a difficult time for britton.
p376_119|i was furious.
p376_120|she really suffered for her art.
p376_121|so the european elections are extremely important.
p376_122|death is outside the language.
p376_123|buckingham palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p376_124|some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p376_125|well you can have a tree.
p376_126|twaddle is a case in point.
p376_127|it will be too hot.
p376_128|it's the big omission.
p376_129|if not a deal could take many months.
p376_130|we had a great time when we came with easy rider.
p376_131|the scottish socialist party is also expected to attend.
p376_132|it's not true.
p376_133|police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p376_134|it was typical.
p376_135|it was not hard to feel some sympathy for baxter yesterday.
p376_136|nobody in the world can get away from him.
p376_137|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p376_138|we've got a lot of respect for the lions.
p376_139|i think he's the favourite no question.
p376_140|the boy is no longer with us.
p376_141|there is a lack of chemistry.
p376_142|is that titanic?
p376_143|i was awful.
p376_144|the idea is simple.
p376_145|it is like a football team.
p376_146|it is not just about pay.
p376_147|he will emerge as a world leader.
p376_148|they did very well.
p376_149|the petition was formally presented at downing street yesterday.
p376_150|the dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p376_151|the weaknesses are few.
p376_152|the woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p376_153|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p376_154|mr blair had done well.
p376_155|we also enjoyed a lot of support.
p376_156|i was in daily contact.
p376_157|alain baxter did not have long to speak on friday.
p376_158|my dad is a hero.
p376_159|the workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p376_160|this year this month will be special for torrance.
p376_161|there's a pause.
p376_162|it was so new so exciting.
p376_163|he's been the key to everything.
p376_164|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p376_165|military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p376_166|i was in the train station overnight.
p376_167|by then however both men were already in the us.
p376_168|they will do their own thing.
p376_169|you had to go and see him.
p376_170|the release attracted little attention.
p376_171|waiting times for these services are too long.
p376_172|a helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p376_173|first and foremost the game is entirely different.
p376_174|this is a sad day.
p376_175|there is no evidence of a little scotland emerging.
p376_176|we are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p376_177|it is the whole package.
p376_178|it's an idea.
p376_179|sir jeremy from glasgow said they had been delighted.
p376_180|i have no sympathy with her at all.
p376_181|mr marshall is expected to join the council of europe.
p376_182|miller was every bit as happy.
p376_183|i saw military vehicles in the distance.
p376_184|the judges will give a ruling next wednesday.
p376_185|what has caused the demise of singing?
p376_186|i had a train to catch.
p376_187|it is a terrible loss.
p376_188|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p376_189|i would love it.
p376_190|last night was a key episode.
p376_191|i am totally surprised.
p376_192|i came home by ambulance.
p376_193|the modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p376_194|we've had an enjoyable adventure.
p376_195|the group is separate from the real ira.
p376_196|is that success?
p376_197|the service from the other players was super.
p376_198|but we are not immune to the problem.
p376_199|the sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p376_200|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p376_201|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p376_202|it was worth a photograph.
p376_203|i don't want to use it.
p376_204|harry potter has lost his magic.
p376_205|that is an important part of our role.
p376_206|i had relied on him.
p376_207|i began to pray.
p376_208|i am delighted for simon.
p376_209|he would discuss the peace process in northern ireland.
p376_210|the fbi could become involved.
p376_211|a final decision will be taken by first minister donald dewar.
p376_212|his death was a tragic accident.
p376_213|on a technical level they were not afraid to play good football.
p376_214|i am really going to miss him.
p376_215|that has been the easy part.
p376_216|we could be here for a number of weeks.
p376_217|clearly the stakes are high.
p376_218|it's a question of creating a future awareness.
p376_219|it is a gamble.
p376_220|at the time he was a living legend.
p376_221|my wife and family are the support system.
p376_222|her condition was yesterday described as critical but stable.
p376_223|dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p376_224|we're looking for justice.
p376_225|however no further action was taken by police.
p376_226|they had no children.
p376_227|and thought we would get away with it.
p376_228|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p376_229|well they were the unlucky ones.
p376_230|it's very safe.
p376_231|sadly it sounds as if it is.
p376_232|hospitals are for the ill.
p376_233|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p376_234|we have a free vote on these things in our party.
p376_235|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p376_236|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p376_237|you can feel at home in china.
p376_238|in short the scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p376_239|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p376_240|it is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p376_241|we will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p376_242|i have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p376_243|i can't get a job.
p376_244|he said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p376_245|we have got no money to go anywhere.
p376_246|i watched a game.
p376_247|chelsea was a great club.
p376_248|the car was just there.
p376_249|i am very angry.
p376_250|the pensioners did not want to know.
p376_251|it is also very valuable.
p376_252|this court has made an order which has not been observed.
p376_253|that is highly unfair.
p376_254|it's all change on the music scene in manchester.
p376_255|it is a crisis of human rights a crisis of leadership.
p376_256|there is no link.
p376_257|they are never here.
p376_258|that review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p376_259|it is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p376_260|he was popular.
p376_261|immediate action must be taken.
p376_262|frankly we should all have such problems.
p376_263|similar measures are expected in england and wales.
p376_264|we are happy.
p376_265|and michael was just great.
p376_266|she has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p376_267|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p376_268|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p376_269|people have no choice.
p376_270|she looked so young.
p376_271|it was a privilege to work for him.
p376_272|it's so awful.
p376_273|if not he should go home.
p376_274|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p376_275|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p376_276|russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p376_277|you've got to have both sides.
p376_278|who will perform?
p376_279|the death toll included five children.
p376_280|parents should avoid it.
p376_282|police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p376_283|it happens from time to time.
p376_284|he was obviously very genuine.
p376_285|it is a vote of confidence in the skills in scotland.
p376_286|he added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p376_287|that could change.
p376_288|he should have won.
p376_289|sunday's game was not a trial.
p376_290|a new school will be built.
p376_291|i have tonight resigned as a member of the european commission.
p376_292|the move was welcomed by the roman catholic church in scotland.
p376_293|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p376_294|he has retired.
p376_295|it became a book by itself.
