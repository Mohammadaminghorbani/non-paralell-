p225_027|so is that it then ?
p225_028|do i have a favourite ?
p225_029|what do we do ?
p225_030|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p225_033|it's really no great surprise because the price difference is so much.
p225_035|a hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
p225_036|it was a close call.
p225_037|in fact they are the future of investment.
p225_038|diving is no part of football.
p225_039|however the decision has been welcomed by scottish enterprise officials.
p225_040|you'd better believe it.
p225_044|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p225_045|people were determined to change the government in the last election.
p225_046|no details of the talks were given.
p225_049|i have learned from him.
p225_051|we are committed to the ban.
p225_052|already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p225_053|i have made that offer.
p225_054|four other charges were dropped.
p225_056|clearly it can go either way.
p225_057|however the city was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p226_037|it is a matter of the utmost concern to the allies.
p226_039|it has failed.
p226_040|it was clear.
p226_041|it is not for any other purpose.
p226_042|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p226_043|is there a new way forward?
p226_044|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p226_045|this represents a tough game for us.
p226_046|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p226_047|we need to chat.
p226_048|it's a blessing.
p226_049|but it might have done.
p226_050|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p226_051|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p226_052|it is the whole package.
p226_053|he had no enemies.
p226_054|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p226_055|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p226_056|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p226_057|it's the big omission.
p226_058|next league matches celtic.
p226_059|she's a spy
p226_060|it is unique.
p226_061|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p226_062|this is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p226_063|it's a real challenge.
p226_064|it is not great art.
p226_065|you do not change overnight.
p226_066|art is extra.
p226_067|it's a matter of balance.
p226_068|scotland had great assets.
p226_069|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p226_070|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p226_071|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p226_072|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p226_073|the script was funny.
p227_040|yesterday he was busy in his office.
p227_041|he looks like an afghan.
p227_042|it will concentrate on the thames valley.
p227_043|i'd come back from london.
p227_044|if i was a woman.
p227_045|he was a home referee.
p227_046|there was no safety net.
p227_047|the casting of her husband was an accident.
p227_048|we have to look beyond the very short term.
p227_049|i expect a rapid response.
p227_050|that is very hard alone.
p227_051|the motive for the shooting was not known.
p227_052|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p227_053|four other charges were dropped.
p227_054|i could not do it.
p227_055|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p227_056|how are you sir ?
p227_057|so is that it then ?
p227_058|do i have a favourite ?
p227_059|what do we do ?
p227_060|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p227_061|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p227_062|they have to come up with a solution.
p227_063|we will pay their bills.
p227_064|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p227_065|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p227_066|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p227_067|i have proved that in the past.
p227_068|he had been a singer.
p227_069|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p227_070|then followed a bout of flu.
p227_071|both sides have been hit by injury.
p227_072|halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p227_073|it is a terrible place.
p227_074|even the one she loved.
p227_075|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p227_076|there may be reasons for it.
p227_077|i first met him last summer.
p227_078|last week he was taken into hospital.
p228_038|president bush is at war.
p228_039|she is believed to be in south africa.
p228_040|my whole life has changed.
p228_041|on this showing they should stick with the lads.
p228_042|no meaningful response was issued.
p228_043|it is urgent.
p228_044|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p228_045|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p228_046|we need to chat.
p228_047|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p228_048|the scottish parliament is also looking at similar measures.
p228_049|but it might have done.
p228_050|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p228_051|mary archer is almost too clever.
p228_052|he looks like an afghan.
p228_053|here's a clue.
p228_054|it had been in place since last july.
p228_055|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p228_056|that's the day job.
p228_057|for the moment that is the result of the x ray.
p228_058|that's the truth.
p228_059|that is very hard alone.
p228_060|he will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p228_061|four other charges were dropped.
p228_062|they're appalled by that.
p228_063|there was a battle there.
p228_064|scotland had great assets.
p228_065|it's that kind of place.
p228_066|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p228_067|an appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p228_068|and if he hadn't become a musician ?
p228_069|he is a young man with a new deal.
p228_070|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p228_071|the script was funny.
p228_072|try to save us.
p228_073|sounds like the sixth sense ?
p228_074|painful but only because it's true.
p229_038|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p229_039|they're just different.
p229_040|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p229_041|it is not for any other purpose.
p229_042|he did not know his daughter.
p229_043|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p229_044|i was scared.
p229_045|it will come all right.
p229_046|but it took a lot of bottle.
p229_047|but it is all by design.
p229_048|i am just going to go for it.
p229_050|we need to chat.
p229_051|it is difficult for ali.
p229_052|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.

p229_059|my mother is a widow.
p229_060|and a film maker was born.
p229_061|art is extra.
p229_062|scotland had great assets.
p229_063|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p229_064|we should have known.
p229_065|it is like a river running by my home.
p229_066|try to save us.
p229_067|that was the easy election.
p229_068|i was as strong as a horse.
p229_069|ferguson should take note.
p229_070|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p229_071|neither it is.
p229_072|she died in hospital two hours later.
p229_073|it was chaotic.
p229_074|it is a job creation scheme.
p229_075|it works for us.
p229_076|i've not thought about it.
p230_044|that was the theory anyway.
p230_045|i was inspired by two things.
p230_046|if not he should go home.
p230_047|i must take a seat.
p230_048|it was bound to happen.
p230_049|we have to bring in new players.
p230_050|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p230_051|i have made that offer.
p230_052|none has ever been found.
p230_053|four other charges were dropped.
p230_054|we should be able to cope.
p230_055|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.

p230_059|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p230_060|it's not covered by the insurance.
p230_061|but the challenge is in the us.
p230_062|robin williams is very subdued.
p230_063|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p230_064|they would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p230_065|both sides have been hit by injury.
p230_066|he also received a medal of honour.
p230_068|it may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p230_069|it is a job creation scheme.
p230_070|it looks like a hit.
p230_071|what do we do ?
p230_072|why do it otherwise ?
p230_073|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p230_074|however he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p230_075|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p230_076|consumer confidence remains an issue.
p230_077|last week he was taken into hospital.
p230_078|this is a true story.
p230_079|by then he was walking on water.
p230_080|it's so hard to shift.
p230_081|they lived for their children.
p230_083|it might change your life.
p230_084|you are a great player.
p230_085|however it did not end that way.
p231_047|a win is a win.
p231_048|there was no safety net.
p231_049|there's nothing we could do about this.
p231_050|it is a symbolic concert.
p231_051|we keep an eye on it.
p231_052|we have not given up hope.
p231_053|the cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p231_054|she said she was really sorry.
p231_055|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p231_056|italy is a beautiful place.
p231_057|four other charges were dropped.
p231_058|we should be able to cope.
p231_059|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p231_061|so is that it then ?
p231_062|do i have a favourite ?
p231_063|what do we do ?
p231_064|it was a lovely experience.
p231_065|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p231_066|we will pay their bills.
p231_067|only water is currently allowed.
p231_068|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p231_069|we need to increase the membership.
p231_070|this is an exciting new venture.
p231_071|he highlighted a lack of staff.
p231_072|then followed a bout of flu.
p231_073|both sides have been hit by injury.
p231_074|both men were on one year contracts.
p231_076|that would be too easy.
p231_078|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p231_079|both agreed on the success of the event.
p231_080|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p231_081|on saturday it was much the same.
p231_082|it's so hard to shift.
p231_083|they lived for their children.
p231_085|however it did not end that way.
p231_086|strathclyde police declined to comment.
p231_087|it is an old family habit.
p231_088|he's been hit by it.
p231_089|however a decision should be made before the end of august.
p231_090|i saw the whole thing.
p231_091|but i know the course.
p231_092|their attitude is all wrong.
p231_093|we must stop it with the golf ball.
p231_094|you are like an animal.
p231_095|this is the logic of punishment assaults.
p231_097|we should recognise others have done a good job.
p232_042|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p232_043|but it took a lot of bottle.
p232_044|we will push.
p232_045|it is urgent.
p232_046|the judge said.
p232_047|it is difficult for ali.
p232_048|but it might have done.
p232_049|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p232_050|they had to explain it.
p232_051|here's a clue.
p232_052|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p232_053|it's the big omission.
p232_054|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p232_055|it's very odd.
p232_056|because we do not need it.
p232_057|it's not pretty but it's effective.
p232_058|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p232_059|that's the truth.
p232_060|that is very hard alone.
p232_061|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p232_062|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p232_063|you do not change overnight.
p232_064|people love to see this stuff.
p232_065|he was popular.
p232_066|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p232_067|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p232_068|it is like a river running by my home.
p232_069|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p232_070|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p232_071|painful but only because it's true.
p232_072|that was the easy election.
p232_073|there could be a way back.
p232_074|then followed a bout of flu.
p232_075|the price cuts are really exciting.
p232_076|i had my suspicions.
p232_077|it was chaotic.
p232_078|it is a job creation scheme.
p232_079|he is now resident in england.
p232_080|i've got the shirt.
p232_081|today she has been released.
p232_082|what has changed ?
p233_043|that means an extra two years.
p233_044|at the moment we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p233_045|all businesses continue to trade.
p233_046|the man became a reporter.
p233_047|it depends on the decisions of the member states.
p233_048|it is all starting to come together.
p233_049|part of the complex is historic.
p233_050|the strategy is not without risk.
p233_051|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p233_052|i was released after six days.
p233_053|yesterday he was busy in his office.
p233_054|we are working on it.
p233_055|i've never been one for complaining about the press.
p233_056|this trend is likely to strengthen.
p233_057|still he did not let himself down this week.
p233_058|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p233_059|there was no safety net.
p233_060|he looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p233_061|you have to be patient.
p233_062|that is all in the past.
p233_063|that could be a mistake.
p233_064|it was an amazing result.
p233_065|indeed it is only the beginning.
p233_066|he has not been dropped.
p233_067|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p233_068|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p233_070|this time it might be for real.
p233_071|she did that for the rest of her life.
p233_072|seriously we are not concerned at all.
p233_073|it starts with the script.
p233_074|we were under a bit of pressure.
p233_075|the talks were announced yesterday by brian wilson the foreign office minister.
p233_076|we can all make a mistake.
p233_077|last night the move was bitterly denounced by france telecom.
p233_079|however he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p233_080|on the night it was not enough.
p233_081|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p234_037|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p234_038|victory was never in doubt.
p234_039|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p234_040|we are the party of the future.
p234_041|i have never been a member of the council.
p234_042|he was in his element.
p234_043|that means an extra two years.
p234_044|at the moment we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p234_045|all businesses continue to trade.

p234_068|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p234_069|the market is appalling for initial public offerings.
p234_070|this time it might be for real.
p234_071|she did that for the rest of her life.
p234_072|seriously we are not concerned at all.
p236_053|we keep an eye on it.
p236_054|the city welcomed the brighter outlook.
p236_055|we felt it was sufficient.
p236_056|you must have a government and a good civil service.
p236_057|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p236_058|you should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p236_059|but retail banking would be run from halifax.
p236_060|i have proved that in the past.
p236_061|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p236_062|i was very pleased with them today though.
p236_063|i was as strong as a horse.
p236_064|then followed a bout of flu.
p236_065|the talks were announced yesterday by brian wilson the foreign office minister.
p236_066|both men were on one year contracts.
p236_068|halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p236_069|it is a job creation scheme.
p236_070|he was seen as the enemy.
p236_071|it looks like a hit.
p236_072|these people are not big names.
p236_073|this view was echoed by the other scottish analyst.
p236_074|we did it for the jersey.
p236_075|the festival is prepared to help.
p236_076|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p236_077|by then he was walking on water.
p236_078|he was just a journalist.
p236_079|on saturday it was much the same.
p236_080|they lived for their children.
p236_081|we have turned the corner.
p236_083|the queen mother is dead.
p236_084|however the approach is not believed to be hostile.
p236_085|change will however have to be in euros.
p236_086|it was a big departure.
p236_087|does it matter ?
p236_088|how do you take them away ?
p236_089|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p236_090|after the match do you ?
p236_091|the oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p236_092|the vast bulk of its funds are run by aberdeen.
p236_093|it is open season on the old firm.
p236_094|the court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p236_095|i had a ball today.
p236_096|he refused to name the survivors.
p236_097|that time is not now however.
p236_098|we created so many chances.
p236_099|before the game we went for a pint.
p236_100|our house was very small.
p236_101|it will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p236_102|it became difficult for me.
p236_103|it's not a lack of effort.
p237_035|i'd like to continue that record.
p237_036|they're just different.
p237_037|it was clear.
p237_038|it is not for any other purpose.
p237_039|the problem is the pitch.
p237_040|it's a great thing.
p237_041|he did not know his daughter.
p237_042|this film will be totally awesome.
p237_043|that is a break with tradition.
p237_044|it's the only thing.
p237_045|it is so sad.

p237_047|it is urgent.
p237_048|i feel pretty good.
p237_049|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p237_050|it is bizarre.
p237_051|that should do it.
p237_052|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p237_053|she looked so young.
p237_054|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p237_055|life is good.
p237_056|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.

p237_060|new york is expected to come to a standstill.
p237_061|i've had six days of rehearsal.

p237_066|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p237_067|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p237_068|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p238_046|separate approvals would be needed for these.
p238_047|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p238_048|among them are many criminals.
p238_049|it comes from reflection or thinking.
p238_050|the whole thing was filmed in hollywood.
p238_051|and they removed a borderer.
p238_052|he is too weak to move.
p238_053|does it matter ?
p238_054|how do you take them away ?
p238_055|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p238_056|after the match do you ?
p238_057|has the conflict started ?
p238_058|have i really come to this ?
p238_059|they desperately want some stability.
p238_060|well he is an artist.
p238_061|we work for the athlete.
p238_062|he looks like an afghan.
p238_063|everything else is a bonus.
p238_064|he will need that machine.
p238_065|we hadn't really taken that seriously before.
p238_066|it's the performance we want.
p238_067|then they scored two goals to win.
p238_068|in fact it was geoffrey robinson.
p238_069|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p238_070|the labour party's not downbeat and neither is the labour government.
p238_071|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p238_072|i had relied on him.
p238_073|and then there's the racial hassle.
p238_074|we felt it was sufficient.
p238_075|the wingers must have felt the cold.
p238_076|i am relishing the challenge.
p238_077|i have made that offer.
p238_078|no plans for projects are yet in place.
p238_079|but the organisers refused to worry.
p238_080|we have to keep our clients.
p238_081|we should be able to cope.
p238_082|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p238_083|the two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p238_084|he's very young and very keen to do well.
p238_085|it is somewhere to be.
p238_086|we should all be grateful.
p238_087|we will pay their bills.
p238_088|it was exactly four months away.
p238_089|this is equally relevant to the landowner.
p238_090|he thought she was amazing.
p239_051|new york is my home.
p239_052|the head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.

p239_055|he is too weak to move.
p239_056|bill clinton always had an idea to sell.
p239_057|i feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
p239_058|among them are many criminals.
p239_059|that's been the difference between the sides.
p239_060|and they removed a borderer.
p239_061|all manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p239_062|perhaps we should do the same.
p239_063|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p239_064|they were on holiday in egypt.
p239_065|they desperately want some stability.
p239_066|everything is possible in football.

p239_070|the new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on tv.

p239_073|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p239_074|the labour party's not downbeat and neither is the labour government.
p239_075|let's not be too despondent.
p239_076|the government does not go far enough.
p239_077|he phoned the number in the brochure.
p239_078|i haven't got there yet.
p239_079|i can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p239_080|they hoped to remain in the edinburgh area.
p239_081|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p239_082|labour has replaced the tories as the party of the family.
p239_083|but the organisers refused to worry.
p239_084|and it had two seats.
p239_085|indeed it is only the beginning.
p239_086|or so the theory goes.
p239_087|he has really done well.
p239_088|so what happens next ?
p239_089|had this been common practice ?
p239_090|what do they want us to do ?
p239_091|is it worth it ?
p239_092|does it matter ?
p239_093|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p239_094|but i had never been in a theatre.
p239_095|it was fun but not a living.
p239_096|kenny miller might come through.
p239_097|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p239_098|the government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p239_099|we will pay their bills.
p239_100|sales are falling after years of growth.
p240_038|it has failed.
p240_039|they're just different.
p240_040|it's a real threat.
p240_041|it was the eighties.
p240_042|indeed he does.
p240_043|president bush is at war.
p240_044|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p240_045|on this showing they should stick with the lads.
p240_046|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p240_047|it is so sad.
p240_048|that period was a struggle.
p240_049|this represents a tough game for us.
p240_050|who can say?
p240_051|it's a blessing.
p240_052|the yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p240_053|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p240_054|he is too weak to move.
p240_055|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p240_056|he had no enemies.
p240_057|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p240_058|however the drama was still not at an end.
p240_059|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p240_060|that's the truth.
p240_061|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p240_062|i've had six days of rehearsal.
p240_063|he will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p240_064|art is extra.
p240_065|scotland had great assets.
p240_066|they are real.
p240_067|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p240_068|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p240_069|it should be devolved.
p240_070|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p240_071|it came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p240_072|i was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p240_073|i was as strong as a horse.
p240_074|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p240_075|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p241_039|it is not for any other purpose.
p241_040|president bush is at war.
p241_041|it was ugly.
p241_042|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p241_043|that period was a struggle.
p241_044|this represents a tough game for us.
p241_045|we need to chat.
p241_046|that time has passed.
p241_047|as she explains.
p241_048|he is too weak to move.
p241_049|he is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p241_050|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p241_051|he looks like an afghan.
p241_052|we've got a lot of respect for the lions.
p241_053|however the drama was still not at an end.
p241_055|next league matches celtic.
p241_056|gerhard schroeder was the victor.
p241_057|what was the main difference?
p241_058|i was an athlete.
p241_059|there was a battle there.
p241_061|it was all in a short period of time.
p241_062|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p241_063|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p241_064|the script was funny.
p241_065|he could make it.
p241_066|try to save us.
p241_067|sounds like the sixth sense?
p241_068|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p241_069|i was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p241_070|the company yesterday refused to comment.
p241_071|he highlighted a lack of staff.
p241_072|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p241_073|both sides have been hit by injury.
p241_074|the girls are so lucky to be alive.
p241_075|it is a job creation scheme.
p243_041|hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p243_042|he does not even trust his own members.
p243_043|he too started on the subs seats.
p243_044|is it worth it ?
p243_045|does it matter ?
p243_046|how do you take them away ?
p243_047|however there is an issue isn't there ?
p243_048|after the match do you ?
p243_049|has the conflict started ?
p243_050|have i really come to this ?
p243_051|i'm as fit as i can get.
p243_052|we took part in a festival called global dance.
p243_053|he said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p243_054|the important retail business continues to deliver excellent results stewart said.
p243_055|andy was a huge influence yet again.
p243_056|they seem too much of a sure thing.
p243_057|her husband had been waiting for her return.
p243_058|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p243_059|we just want this season to end.
p243_060|it was a day she thought she would never see.
p243_061|talks have continued at many different levels.
p243_062|the referee is there to decide these things.
p243_063|there were no details of the other five victims.
p243_064|it also has a good labour supply.
p243_065|indeed he has a lot of output.
p243_066|do not give your details to anyone.
p243_067|he was failed by his health authority.
p243_068|but it was not all bad news.
p243_069|i cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p243_070|but during the bid process that changed completely.
p243_071|it turned me against the whole system.
p243_072|she seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p243_073|i saw the story but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p243_074|but two groups refused to sign up.
p243_075|i was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p243_076|it had little effect on european equity markets.
p243_077|i'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p243_078|the key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p243_079|the squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p244_044|if we cannot succeed in this endeavour then so be it.
p244_045|they are going after them.
p244_046|it is all about the story.
p244_047|the whole thing is the music.
p244_048|in fact they are the future of investment.
p244_049|that is still the case.
p244_050|at the moment we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p244_051|in my view it has to be done.
p244_052|the pressure on the players will build.
p244_053|their campaign is in disarray.
p244_054|but after a dip in sales growth was recorded.
p244_055|yesterday he was busy in his office.
p244_056|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p244_057|clearly they had other problems.
p244_058|this trend is likely to strengthen.
p244_059|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p244_060|we have got to deliver.
p244_061|that was the difference today.
p244_062|the company continues to grow.
p244_063|he said it was for sale.
p244_064|we felt it was sufficient.
p244_065|that is all in the past.
p244_066|there is a lot to be done.
p244_067|but that's another story for another day.
p244_068|he has not been dropped.
p244_069|it was an outstanding performance.
p244_070|i can't remember a lot about the accident.
p244_071|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p244_072|it is only the beginning.
p244_073|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p244_074|only water is currently allowed.
p244_075|this time it might be for real.
p244_076|she did that for the rest of her life.
p244_077|seriously we are not concerned at all.
p244_078|that will be the office.
p244_079|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p244_080|how are you sir ?
p244_081|so is that it then ?
p244_082|do i have a favourite ?
p244_083|what do we do ?
p244_084|why do it otherwise ?
p244_085|it starts with the script.
p245_036|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p245_037|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p245_038|it has failed.
p245_039|it was clear.
p245_040|it's a great thing.
p245_041|indeed he does.
p245_042|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p245_043|she is believed to be in south africa.
p245_044|but it took a lot of bottle.
p245_045|sure it's funny.
p245_046|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p245_047|this represents a tough game for us.
p245_048|we need to chat.
p245_049|the boy is no longer with us.
p245_050|who can say?
p245_051|it's a blessing.
p245_053|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p245_054|they had to explain it.
p245_055|he had no enemies.
p245_056|sadly it can't.
p245_057|none has ever been found.
p245_058|it's a matter of balance.
p245_059|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p245_060|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p245_061|hopefully we have learned a lot from that game.
p245_062|he should have asked for a second opinion.
p245_063|he was popular.
p245_064|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p245_065|the script was funny.
p245_066|you need a trademark.
p245_067|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p245_068|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p245_069|she died in hospital two hours later.
p245_070|is there a new way forward?
p245_071|there was no mention of an amnesty in the belfast agreement.
p246_037|they're just different.
p246_038|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p246_039|indeed he does.
p246_040|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p246_041|the ambition this year is to improve on last.
p246_042|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p246_043|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p246_044|we will push.
p246_045|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p246_046|they said she was stable.
p246_047|is a drug dealer?
p246_048|there is no reason at all.
p246_049|the state would provide.
p246_050|she looked so young.
p246_051|every aspect of our play was first class.
p246_052|here's a clue.
p246_053|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p246_054|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p246_055|it is unique.
p246_056|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p246_057|that's the truth.
p246_058|i feel i did not have enough time.
p246_059|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p246_060|scotland had great assets.
p246_061|it's that kind of place.
p246_062|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p246_063|he could make it.
p246_064|sounds like the sixth sense?
p246_065|robin williams is very subdued.
p246_066|the tournament has now been cancelled.
p246_067|there could be a way back.
p246_068|then followed a bout of flu.
p246_069|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p246_070|it is a job creation scheme.
p246_071|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p246_072|even the one she loved.
p247_049|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p247_050|the outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p247_051|we would have concerns about suspension.
p247_052|the couple actually came upon the accident.
p247_053|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p247_054|italy is a beautiful place.
p247_055|we have to keep our clients.
p247_056|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p247_057|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p247_058|how are you sir ?
p247_059|so is that it then ?
p247_060|do i have a favourite ?
p247_061|what do we do ?
p247_062|why do it otherwise ?
p247_063|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p247_064|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p247_065|we will pay their bills.
p247_066|we could soon be in that same position
p247_067|it came as a surprise.
p247_068|the farmer wants a new campaign.
p247_069|only water is currently allowed.
p247_070|it's not covered by the insurance.
p247_071|final proposals will be published in february.
p247_072|you should try to have a laugh.
p247_073|robin williams is very subdued.
p247_074|it wasn't possible to relax.
p247_075|i was very pleased with them today though.
p247_076|the spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p247_077|i was as strong as a horse.
p247_078|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p247_079|both men were on one year contracts.
p247_080|halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p247_081|she died in hospital two hours later.
p247_082|it happens on an annual basis.
p247_083|it is a job creation scheme.
p247_084|the party is up for it.
p247_085|even the one she loved.
p247_086|it makes for an interesting conference.
p247_087|i've had it for the exams.
p247_088|those people must be accountable.
p247_089|we feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p247_090|petrol prices were widely blamed.
p247_091|we have to offer value for money.
p247_092|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p247_093|on saturday it was much the same.
p247_094|they lived for their children.
p247_095|potions said he would drive.
p247_096|the woman is basically off her head.
p248_038|but it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p248_039|it was clear.
p248_040|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p248_041|she is believed to be in south africa.
p248_042|i was scared.
p248_043|it was ugly.
p248_044|that is a break with tradition.
p248_045|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p248_046|no meaningful response was issued.
p248_047|it is urgent.
p248_048|failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p248_049|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p248_050|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p248_051|but it might have done.
p248_052|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p248_053|he looks like an afghan.
p248_054|they had to explain it.
p248_055|here's a clue.
p248_056|but the law is very clear on this.
p248_057|next league matches celtic.
p248_058|it's very odd.
p248_059|it will take time.
p248_060|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p248_061|we have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p248_062|four other charges were dropped.
p248_063|it is not great art.
p248_064|it's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p248_065|scotland had great assets.
p248_066|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p248_067|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p248_068|it's good news and long overdue.
p248_069|have a look at our accounts.
p248_070|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p248_071|there was an e mail.
p248_072|then followed a bout of flu.
p248_073|neither it is.
p248_074|i had my suspicions.
p248_075|he got the same story.
p249_036|it was clear.
p249_037|it is not for any other purpose.
p249_038|he did not know his daughter.
p249_039|she is believed to be in south africa.
p249_040|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p249_041|sure it's funny.
p249_042|it's a crucial award.
p249_043|the boy is no longer with us.
p249_044|it's a blessing.
p249_045|is a drug dealer?
p249_046|as she explains.
p249_047|he is too weak to move.
p249_048|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p249_049|i would love to have him home.
p249_050|he looks like an afghan.
p249_051|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p249_052|it will come all right.
p249_053|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p249_054|next league matches celtic.
p249_055|it happens from time to time.
p249_056|it's very odd.
p249_057|already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p249_058|it is unique.
p249_059|it will take time.
p249_060|that's the truth.
p249_061|jobs could go.
p249_062|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p249_063|i'm just enjoying every match.
p249_064|and a film maker was born.
p249_065|you did not change overnight.
p249_066|there was a battle there.
p249_067|scotland had great assets.
p249_068|i've spent a lot of time on buses.

p250_054|i had trouble with the producers.
p250_055|the teacher would have approved.
p250_056|the city welcomed the brighter outlook.
p250_057|i expect a rapid response.
p250_058|she said she was really sorry.
p250_059|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p250_060|there's still plenty time left.
p250_061|let's hope that it does.
p250_062|we have to keep our clients.
p250_063|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p250_064|companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
p250_065|this is the first step.

p250_067|we are talking about the outskirts of london.
p250_068|the farmer wants a new campaign.
p250_069|only water is currently allowed.

p250_072|robin williams is very subdued.
p250_073|it wasn't possible to relax.
p250_074|we need to increase the membership.
p250_075|there's nothing they can get on me.
p250_076|i was as strong as a horse.
p250_077|he was a lovely man.
p250_078|both sides have been hit by injury.
p250_079|we had a court hearing in london yesterday.
p250_080|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p250_081|it makes for an interesting conference.
p250_082|i've had it for the exams.
p250_083|this view was echoed by the other scottish analyst.
p250_084|the tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.

p250_086|he put some colour into scottish history.
p250_087|they lived for their children.
p250_088|potions said he would drive.
p250_089|i think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
p250_090|william hague the guest of honour was delighted.
p250_091|we are progressing with a few interested parties.
p250_092|that view is held by many others within the industry.
p250_093|the excitement could hardly be contained.
p250_094|the commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p250_095|it is high time to act.
p250_096|why do it otherwise ?
p250_097|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p250_098|so did she meet him ?
p251_038|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p251_039|in both cases i suffered a fiasco.
p251_040|it was clear.
p251_041|they may be wrong.
p251_042|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p251_043|dancing was her life.
p251_044|we will push.
p251_045|i feel pretty good.
p251_046|that should do it.
p251_047|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p251_048|as she explains.
p251_049|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p251_050|it is the whole package.
p251_051|he had no enemies.
p251_052|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p251_053|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p251_054|i had relied on him.
p251_055|this is a step backwards.
p251_056|already he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p251_057|what was the main difference?
p251_058|four other charges were dropped.
p251_059|it's a real challenge.
p251_060|it is not great art.
p251_061|they're appalled by that.
p251_062|it's that kind of place.
p251_063|it was all in a short period of time.
p251_064|an appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p251_065|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p251_066|he was popular.
p251_067|he becomes the new minister for sport and culture.
p251_068|that was the easy election.
p251_069|there could be a way back.
p251_070|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p251_071|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p251_072|it was chaotic.
p251_073|it is a time bomb.
p252_041|i'm so happy that she did.
p252_042|we took part in a festival called global dance.
p252_043|this operation will change her life.
p252_044|something old something new as it were.
p252_045|the youngsters have put us in a strong position.
p252_046|they seem too much of a sure thing.
p252_047|that's what set him apart.
p252_048|you must always attempt to raise the bar.
p252_050|the head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p252_051|she continued to enjoy sport.
p252_052|downing street also rejected the calls for a european army.
p252_053|by all accounts he was delighted.
p252_054|schools will not want change.
p252_055|i think i'm a bit too young.
p252_056|he was failed by his health authority.
p252_057|we wish to win but not at any price.
p252_058|i agree with you about this.
p252_059|or so he thought.
p252_060|must be prepared to use it.
p252_061|the fifth was found later.
p252_062|for a decade she was proved right.
p252_063|it was dangerous but vital employment.
p252_064|our people are ready.
p252_065|these figures cover the major british banking groups.
p252_066|probably he wasn't thinking at all.
p252_067|some of their players seemed almost dead.
p252_068|people come to see the highlands.
p252_069|it would have to be.
p252_071|this is a great opportunity for us.
p252_072|that is not possible.
p252_073|none has ever been found.
p252_074|insurance will perhaps reduce.
p252_075|their time has gone.
p252_076|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p252_077|how are you sir ?
p252_078|so is that it then ?
p252_079|do i have a favourite ?
p252_080|what do we do ?
p252_081|why do it otherwise ?
p252_082|what kind of a man does that mr dick ?
p253_041|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p253_042|dancing was her life.
p253_043|the ambition this year is to improve on last.
p253_044|it is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p253_045|they want to be entertained.
p253_046|it's the only thing.
p253_047|you had better believe it.
p253_048|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.
p253_049|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p253_050|a neighbour said.
p253_051|it is bizarre.
p253_052|there is no reason at all.
p253_053|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p253_054|every aspect of our play was first class.
p253_055|our people are ready.
p253_056|here's a clue.
p253_057|i was lost.
p253_058|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p253_059|my fitness was very poor.
p253_060|several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p253_061|it is unique.
p253_062|i expect a rapid response.
p253_063|it happened so quickly.
p253_064|that's the truth.
p253_065|it seems to have worked.
p253_066|this is the first step.
p253_067|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p253_068|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p253_069|i am pleased with the result as it was a possible upset.
p253_071|sounds like the sixth sense?
p253_072|robin williams is very subdued.
p253_073|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p253_074|it could take some time.
p253_075|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p253_076|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p253_077|it is a job creation scheme.
p253_078|the party is up for it.
p253_079|people must remain vigilant.
p254_041|it is not for any other purpose.
p254_042|the main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p254_043|i was scared.
p254_044|however the decision has been welcomed by scottish enterprise officials.
p254_045|no meaningful response was issued.
p254_046|that period was a struggle.
p254_047|i am just going to go for it.
p254_048|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p254_049|this represents a tough game for us.
p254_050|it's a crucial award.
p254_051|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p254_052|that should do it.
p254_053|it's a blessing.
p254_054|is a drug dealer?
p254_055|but it might have done.
p254_056|that time has passed.
p254_057|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p254_058|he is too weak to move.
p254_059|life is good.
p254_060|it is the whole package.
p254_061|this is a club on the rise.
p254_062|he had no enemies.
p254_063|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p254_064|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p254_065|that's the day job.
p254_066|in the current outbreak the reverse is true.
p254_067|this obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p254_068|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p254_069|my mother is a widow.
p254_070|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p254_071|jobs could go.
p254_072|four other charges were dropped.
p254_073|they're appalled by that.
p254_074|there was a battle there.
p254_075|it's good news and long overdue.
p254_076|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p254_077|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p254_078|they never gave up hope.
p254_079|it came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p254_080|painful but only because it's true.
p255_038|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p255_039|it is a memorial.
p255_040|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p255_041|but it might have done.
p255_042|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p255_043|people were determined to change the government in the last election.
p255_044|i felt really good until friday.
p255_045|she looked so young.
p255_046|life is good.
p255_047|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p255_048|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p255_049|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p255_050|it was not hard to feel some sympathy for baxter yesterday.
p255_051|mr blair is the problem in scotland not the solution.
p255_052|it's very odd.
p255_053|because we do not need it.
p255_054|that's the truth.
p255_055|my mother is a widow.
p255_057|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p255_058|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p255_059|equity declined to comment.
p255_060|hopefully we have learned a lot from that game.
p255_061|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p255_062|there was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p255_063|we should have known.
p255_064|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p255_065|the end result is precisely the same.
p255_066|it came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p255_067|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p255_068|there could be a way back.
p255_069|he highlighted a lack of staff.
p255_070|then followed a bout of flu.
p255_071|ferguson should take note.
p255_072|it works for us.
p255_073|he is now resident in england.
p255_074|i've got the shirt.
p255_075|two israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p255_076|what has changed?
p256_032|they did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p256_033|then suddenly they weren't.
p256_034|a web site is planned for november.
p256_035|it can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p256_036|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p256_037|at this stage we think the air campaign is enough.
p256_038|they're just different.
p256_039|it's a real threat.
p256_040|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p256_041|it had been played at festivals.
p256_042|indeed he does.
p256_043|she is believed to be in south africa.
p256_044|this film will be totally awesome.
p256_045|no meaningful response was issued.
p256_046|that period was a struggle.
p256_047|a neighbour said.
p256_048|it's a crucial award.
p256_049|it is difficult for ali.
p256_050|it's a blessing.
p256_051|is a drug dealer?
p256_052|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p256_053|i would love to have him home.
p256_054|no one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p256_055|he had no enemies.
p256_056|sadly it can't.
p256_057|there would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p256_058|it is unique.
p256_059|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p256_060|that's the truth.
p256_061|that is very hard alone.
p256_062|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p256_063|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p257_044|i hate the word.
p257_045|that should do it.
p257_046|it's a blessing.
p257_047|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p257_048|as she explains.
p257_049|yesterday he had a chilling warning for the game in scotland.
p257_050|he had no enemies.
p257_051|i got a great response from the players as i had expected.
p257_052|but the law is very clear on this.
p257_053|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p257_054|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p257_055|next league matches celtic.
p257_056|it's very odd.
p257_057|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p257_058|it is not great art.
p257_059|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p257_060|there was a battle there.
p257_061|scotland had great assets.
p257_062|there will be tough opponents to this report.
p257_063|have a look at our accounts.
p257_064|sounds like the sixth sense?
p257_065|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p257_066|i was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p257_067|it's all i can do.
p257_068|there could be a way back.
p257_069|they do not work for glasgow city council.
p257_070|the price cuts are really exciting.
p257_071|chris smith the culture secretary said he was satisfied with the decision.
p257_072|i had my suspicions.
p257_073|she died in hospital two hours later.
p257_074|it was chaotic.
p257_075|is there a new way forward?
p257_076|i've not thought about it.
p257_077|people must remain vigilant.
p257_078|mr irvine said mr rafferty was now in good spirits.
p257_079|it is not long term but i need time to recover.
p257_080|it is linked to the row over proposed changes at scottish ballet.
p257_081|it may well have been.
p257_082|he liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p257_083|he seems to be pleased with the picture.
p257_084|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p257_085|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p257_086|it's never too late.
p259_049|i had come back from london.
p259_050|pulled a huge number of viewers.
p259_051|i had trouble with the producers.
p259_052|maybe full time referees will provide the answer.
p259_053|we have not given up hope.
p259_054|in time the first minister will grow in stature.
p259_055|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p259_056|they had been in scotland on exercise.
p259_057|let's hope that it does.
p259_058|we have to keep our clients.
p259_059|he also has a scottish grandfather.
p259_060|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p259_061|the farmer wants a new campaign.
p259_062|he hadn't had them for a long time.
p259_063|only water is currently allowed.
p259_064|it wasn't possible to relax.
p259_065|we should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p259_066|last night the move was bitterly denounced by france telecom.
p259_067|she died in hospital two hours later.
p259_068|it is a job creation scheme.
p259_069|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p259_070|even the one she loved.
p259_071|today it was really enjoyable.
p259_072|just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p259_073|it was a unanimous decision.
p259_074|it makes for an interesting conference.
p259_075|i've had it for the exams.
p259_076|i first met him last summer.
p259_077|i wanted to change the formula.
p259_078|it gave no further details.
p259_079|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p259_080|our mother is very worried.
p259_081|potions said he would drive.
p259_082|the city council is a major property owner in the area.
p259_083|william hague the guest of honour was delighted.
p259_084|it is normal for me.
p259_085|why do you want to come to edinburgh ?
p259_086|how are you sir ?
p259_087|so is that it then ?
p259_088|do i have a favourite ?
p259_089|what do we do ?
p259_090|why do it otherwise ?
p259_091|what kind of man does that mr dick ?
p259_092|western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p259_093|the commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p259_094|collaboration is also encouraged by the medical research council and other bodies.
p259_095|the allegations were still under investigation he added.
p259_096|we would have concerns about that.
p260_036|then suddenly they weren't.
p260_037|it's a fact.
p260_038|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p260_039|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p260_040|of course on tuesday united were beaten despite this.
p260_041|dancing was her life.
p260_042|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p260_043|we will push.
p260_044|the shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p260_045|among them are many criminals.
p260_046|it is marvellous.
p260_047|every aspect of our play was first class.
p260_048|our people are ready.
p260_049|here's a clue.
p260_050|her body was found about four miles from the car.
p260_051|i was inspired by two things.
p260_052|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p260_053|my fitness was very poor.
p260_054|sadly it can't.
p260_055|he has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p260_056|i expect a rapid response.
p260_057|what was the main difference?
p260_058|there's a danger.
p260_059|we need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p260_060|lancashire police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p260_061|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p260_062|it's that kind of place.
p260_063|they are real.
p260_064|i've spent a lot of time on buses.
p260_065|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p260_066|and if he hadn't become a musician?

p287_048|the teacher would have approved.
p287_049|it is quite a figure.

p287_052|i expect a rapid response.
p287_053|the motive for the shooting was not known.

p287_061|what do we do ?
p287_062|it has been an amazing day.
p287_063|everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise.
p287_064|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p287_065|this is a big step up.
p287_066|there can be no compromise on welfare.
p287_067|both sides have been hit by injury.
p287_068|now the plot is perfect.
p287_069|that would be too easy.
p287_070|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p287_071|it looks like a hit.
p287_072|after five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p287_073|i first met him last summer.
p287_074|we did it for the jersey.
p287_075|here too the post office has missed the boat.
p287_076|by then he was walking on water.
p287_077|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p287_078|the cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p287_079|that was a great performance by the team.
p287_080|it was a total disaster.
p287_081|i've never seen anything like it.
p287_082|he added that he felt undermined.
p287_083|it was not an insult.
p287_084|in each case they were a goal down.
p288_042|we need to chat.
p288_043|but it might have done.
p288_044|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p288_045|he is too weak to move.
p288_046|rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p288_047|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p288_048|it will come all right.
p288_049|i was lost.
p288_050|i guess i was lucky though.
p288_051|i was inspired by two things.
p288_052|sadly it can't.
p288_053|it's very odd.
p288_054|it is unique.
p288_055|it will take time.
p288_056|that's the truth.
p288_057|the story was first reported in the spectator magazine.
p288_058|the problems are a result of that shortfall.
p288_059|four other charges were dropped.
p288_060|lancashire police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p288_061|they're appalled by that.
p288_062|scotland had great assets.
p288_063|equity declined to comment.
p288_064|we should have known.
p288_065|the end result is precisely the same.
p288_066|sounds like the sixth sense?
p288_067|there is an element of racism in scotland.
p288_068|that was the easy election.
p288_069|it shouldn't come as a surprise but it does.
p288_070|neither it is.
p288_071|he seemed to lose his focus.
p288_072|it can be halted.
p288_073|it was chaotic.
p288_074|is there a new way forward?
p288_075|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p288_076|i've not thought about it.
p288_077|people must remain vigilant.
p288_078|this is the way things should be handled.
p288_079|every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p288_080|it's all going to clear the debt.
p288_081|last week he was taken into hospital.
p288_082|nothing is yet confirmed.
p292_055|ms jackson was not at the meeting.
p292_056|i find the whole affair disturbing.
p292_057|one woman refused to sit down.
p292_058|we're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p292_059|i was completely knackered.
p292_060|there are two interests in this woodland.
p292_061|a killer is also on the loose.
p292_062|last night the row continued.
p292_063|our approach will be different.
p292_064|you can see how he made his money.
p292_065|it's really good as long as we play well.
p292_066|we would certainly consider the proposals.
p292_067|we tend to come good at the end.
p292_068|his record with england was not good.
p292_069|lose and they would be ridiculed.
p292_070|three penalties were given.
p292_071|i didn't think they would be that stupid.
p292_072|he was between people and god.
p292_073|we are just being flooded.
p292_074|we could easily have lost that game.
p292_075|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p292_076|there were no proposals on the table.
p292_077|it is true but it is only part of the issue.
p292_078|there's only one word for it.
p292_079|it was very full anyway.
p292_080|that was him under pressure.
p292_081|i can't believe she is dead.
p292_082|i was in prison for a year.
p292_083|among them is his beloved teacher.
p292_084|he had a really frustrating time last year.
p292_085|i am delighted for everyone in airdrie.
p292_086|i am constantly changing my mind.
p292_087|it was deployed in the gulf war.
p292_088|ending a tenancy is a last resort.
p292_089|but he just carried on anyway.
p292_090|we should be capable of managing it though.
p292_091|it was that kind of afternoon.
p292_092|his presence was very important.
p292_093|we are pursuing legal action against the government.
p292_094|he insisted that his staff were too.
p292_095|they should come clean.
p293_042|sub not used mccormick.
p293_043|we can be proud of our achievements.
p293_044|clark is back on top form.
p293_045|he denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p293_046|lothian and borders police are also involved.
p293_047|that was the theory anyway.
p293_048|ferguson must take the blame.
p293_049|this is thought to mean sometime next week.
p293_050|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p293_051|stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p293_052|it is a large number.
p293_053|we felt at the moment it was not possible.
p293_054|general you didn't get a modified.
p293_055|it does not even have a staff shortage.
p293_056|that is our unfinished business.
p293_057|this is far too high.
p293_058|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p293_059|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p293_060|but the foundations have been laid.
p293_061|this was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p293_062|so they will settle again.
p293_063|he had other things on his mind.
p293_064|why did it take a concerted campaign?
p293_065|let us hope so.
p293_066|it can happen to you it can happen to anyone.
p293_067|a lot of people had to wait and people still do.
p293_068|it felt like my support system was leaving.
p293_069|a ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p293_070|i was shaking on the blocks.
p293_071|so the challenge is against ourselves.
p293_072|you see my back has gone.
p293_073|it has been a lovely family occasion.
p293_074|we've had our problems at the club.
p293_075|his behaviour today has been disgusting.
p293_076|more than half of the school collapsed.
p293_077|we also hope to meet the men.
p293_078|i can live with just the one.
p293_079|all the people thought that we would die.
p293_080|sometimes they come off.
p293_081|a teacher is really about unity.
p294_043|we're playing away from home and that's it.
p294_044|i'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p294_045|they tend to be female and retired.
p294_046|who was the mystery mp?
p294_047|this was no accident.
p294_048|i'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p294_049|we've all done it
p294_050|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p294_051|hopefully that'll come from someone on our side.
p294_052|the course record was in his name.
p294_053|but we welcome this document.
p294_054|what is the point of jailing him?
p294_055|we should not bring him into a dispute.
p294_056|this is a possible way forward.
p294_057|i am not here to get even.
p294_058|freedom from serbia is a growing objective.
p294_059|we are only human.
p294_060|i went with the mood.
p294_061|i think we'll just keep it.
p294_062|debate is not just talk.
p294_063|how is he enjoying life as a senior?
p294_064|it is all about having physical evidence.
p294_065|people remember the tories in office.
p294_066|what kind of inclusion is that?
p294_067|i fell in love with it right away.
p294_068|domestic abuse is related to power and control.
p294_069|it makes for an interesting conference.
p294_070|i don't have any answer for them.
p294_071|it took about five or six hours.
p294_072|i found the course inspiring.
p294_073|two things were clear from the new programme.
p294_074|this is the real thing now.
p294_075|until they came to do it.
p294_076|she now lives in london.
p294_077|it will not be a long campaign.
p294_078|subs not used mcgraw.
p294_079|three bystanders were killed.
p294_080|one policeman was killed.
p294_081|they could not have done more for me.
p294_082|it was like a vacuum.
p294_083|that was enough for the committee.
p294_084|it is a very genuine prospect.
p295_044|it is just like any other club.
p295_045|everything is possible in football.
p295_046|i'm sure he didn't mean it.
p295_048|we are going to new broomfield to win.
p295_049|colin is free to speak with other teams.
p295_050|he declined to give further details.
p295_051|i think it was entirely the right decision.
p295_052|broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p295_053|for sure we want to win it.
p295_054|there was only one problem the teacher was still there
p295_055|such debate is pointless.
p295_056|he is helping police with their inquiries.
p295_057|we recorded it at our own expense.
p295_058|a formal decision will be announced within months.
p295_059|i knew there was a challenge for me.
p295_060|social workers are on stand by to help.
p295_061|i just have no maternal instincts.
p295_062|if you're going to do it do it right.
p295_063|they have a car and cannot afford another.
p295_064|it is after all a very funny play.
p295_065|can you imagine a world without design?
p295_066|i am a soldier a soldier a soldier.
p295_067|and he listens to his artists as well.
p295_068|i really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p295_069|so now we know the secret.
p295_070|he's right up to a point.
p295_071|we would have looked out for each other.
p295_072|i had no choice but to leave.
p295_073|where does he go from here?
p295_074|lothian and borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p295_075|this time there were no such rewards.
p295_076|but then they scored their fourth.
p295_077|he said my own position is quite simple.
p295_078|but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p295_079|it has to find out what went wrong.
p295_080|people are already enjoying it.
p295_081|we're just delighted to be back on top.
p295_082|or is it the european approach?
p295_083|i had found my vision.
p295_084|mr wilson has received no such request.
p295_085|however we have not come to any conclusions.
p295_086|there is a contract in existence for allan.
p297_043|he too was unlucky not to get a goal.
p297_044|bombing is the easy option.
p297_045|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p297_046|except for this it was offside.
p297_047|after that time the market itself will set the prices.
p297_048|what do we do for an encore?
p297_049|things start to talk to each other.
p297_050|at the time he was a living legend.
p297_051|i would like to stay with rangers.
p297_052|all will be revealed in due course.
p297_053|it was located on the remote control.
p297_054|january is a bad time of year.
p297_055|harry potter has lost his magic.
p297_056|that is an important part of our role.
p297_057|from our point of view it's the right time.
p297_058|you just have to accept.
p297_059|people will see this over time.
p297_060|the tribunal continues today.
p297_061|basically the classical tradition won out.
p297_062|it obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p297_063|nobody can get at them there.
p297_065|it's not only my respect for them.
p297_066|the police have an awful lot to explain.
p297_067|big brother is listening to you.
p297_068|we will be paying agency rates.
p297_069|this is a very high price.
p297_070|in the end however it all came together.
p297_071|they can be time consuming.
p297_072|it's a depressing difficult and demanding job.
p297_074|subtle it is not.
p297_075|if they don't they can expect their funding to be cut.
p297_076|i had a tie in my hand.
p297_077|raised the way you want it.
p297_078|football is very easy you have to work for the team.
p297_079|then he did it twice.
p297_080|we were short of athletes.
p297_081|you have to do your research.
p297_082|things were so intense in the studio.
p297_083|its first awards will do just that.
p297_084|it was the crowning point of my career.
p297_085|you could feel the heat.
p297_086|she is still very poorly.
p298_041|for one thing he was growing far too quickly.
p298_042|his charisma is all on the course.
p298_043|this is purely financial.
p298_044|i will not be in dialogue with her.
p298_045|our dispute is with the company not with the travelling public.
p298_046|i did not want any damage to us.
p298_047|it was an easy decision to come here.
p298_048|i didn't know the company all that well or the dancers.
p298_049|however you have just got to adjust to it.
p298_050|i saw them not long after it happened.
p298_051|this guy is never going to give up.
p298_052|who said impatience is a virtue?
p298_053|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p298_054|you've got to have everything inside with you.
p298_055|but it obviously doesn't so the government needs to intervene.
p298_056|several hundred people attended yesterday.
p298_057|it was more like a labour party rally.
p298_058|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p298_059|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p298_060|gerhard schroeder was the victor.
p298_061|the supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p298_062|don't say you have not been warned.
p298_063|that is a mark of what you are.
p298_064|seven children had lost both parents.
p298_065|it is par for the course isn't it?
p298_066|who then is going to be captain of europe?
p298_067|most people know that.
p298_068|some people still think she should be english.
p298_069|manager neil cooper revealed yesterday.
p298_070|repayment is not part of the game.
p298_071|the cause of the crash was unclear.
p298_072|what do they pay to join the club?
p298_073|two people are allowed to share the duty.
p298_074|we are now in a safe place.
p298_075|she goes to the opening of an envelope.
p298_076|it will be very useful for us.
p298_077|he was obviously very genuine.
p298_078|we just try to make great records.
p298_079|she had travelled to spain to give evidence.
p298_080|i was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p298_081|it is in other words entrapment by another name.
p299_041|if you have to pay for treatment you pay for treatment.
p299_042|if you look at the beginning of alien.
p299_043|i've learned from my mistakes.
p299_044|today is not about contracts.
p299_045|it should be a great game though.
p299_046|that says something for his strength of character.
p299_047|you see it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p299_048|it's to do with play.
p299_049|usually you should leave it alone in the box.
p299_050|i've just got to do this.
p299_051|rangers will have a massive support in glasgow.
p299_052|that was the problem.
p299_053|ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p299_054|i have been here for only three months.
p299_055|everything else is second.
p299_056|i think it is a sensible change.
p299_057|sex is fun?
p299_058|they were not doing it too well either.
p299_059|he added it's not a racial problem.
p299_060|he had played well in that central role.
p299_061|we hope this scheme will change that.
p299_062|it was created by genocide.
p299_063|it was for me like a week in heaven.
p299_064|how could anyone take issue with that?
p299_065|he takes time out for everyone.
p299_066|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p299_067|now just two games into the season he has gone.
p299_068|a number of people could not speak english.
p299_069|they have got off with murder.
p299_070|they had had time for little else.
p299_071|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p299_072|we have reports of this throughout scotland.
p299_073|it probably didn't feel anything she added.
p299_074|the settlement could run to millions.
p299_075|it does not stop at the border.
p299_076|we've always had three options and none of them are perfect.
p299_077|how can they say that?
p299_078|robert is a special talent.
p299_079|john reid the northern ireland secretary yesterday appealed for restraint.
p299_080|she added it is a huge problem.
p299_081|you can't keep them separate.
p300_040|some people begin to turn away to go home.
p300_041|you're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p300_042|a recording contract is on the horizon.
p300_043|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p300_044|we like being the underdogs.
p300_045|they said construction work could begin within weeks.
p300_046|we will continue to operate within the sport.
p300_047|but the law is very clear on this.
p300_048|but all forms of the illness are treatable.
p300_049|it is also central to the unfolding drama.
p300_050|except for this it was offside.
p300_051|on the contrary some of the music is very expensive.
p300_052|it's a grey area.
p300_053|retirement who knows?
p300_054|he was shocked by what he saw.
p300_055|until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in london.
p300_056|it comes on like a tidal wave.
p300_057|england and wales are likely to pull out.
p300_058|mr cook a left winger from britain would be ideally placed.
p300_059|he was taken ill in december last year.
p300_060|we welcome the decision of mr byers.
p300_061|it's all too short term.
p300_062|this he told the committee was not forthcoming.
p300_063|meanwhile the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p300_064|robin williams is very subdued.
p300_065|his rival's are spoken with elan.
p300_066|he also does not get along with christina.
p300_067|if convicted they face the death penalty.
p300_068|how things have changed since then.
p300_069|therefore it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p300_070|this is the way things should be handled.
p300_071|for me the tour is wide open this year.
p300_072|in the past few years they have started to fight back.
p300_073|the prime minister was very honest and sincere.
p300_074|what are you supposed to do just walk away?
p300_075|she opens tonight in glasgow at the king's theatre.
p300_076|henman is taking nothing for granted.
p300_077|you'd think there was a match on today.
p300_078|we must move on.
p300_079|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p301_042|i have played really well all year.
p301_043|parts of the system are already overstretched.
p301_044|tourism in scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p301_045|it's like if he's all right we will go with him.
p301_046|she added it is the same story in both countries.
p301_047|lara is very very much a girl.
p301_048|i try not to expect anything.
p301_049|lord sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p301_050|there will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p301_051|it was however the wrong side.
p301_052|she is now planning a visit.
p301_053|it also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p301_054|here he is in effect appointing himself a judge.
p301_055|today we begin to answer that question.
p301_056|no it wasn't supposed to do that officials admitted.
p301_057|i keep my fingers crossed.
p301_058|the encounter was to change his life.
p301_059|it's the best of both worlds.
p301_060|they have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p301_061|that is why we want this decision reversed.
p301_062|it didn't work against sweden but that was the intention.
p301_063|staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p301_064|we tried everything but it just wasn't to be today.
p301_065|after this the exercise was due to begin.
p301_066|and she doesn't feel like annika is better.
p301_067|i want my country to be a republic not an empire.
p301_068|celtic connections is here again and the great debate.
p301_069|i'm just feeling very tired but it's great.
p301_070|when he took over it really took off.
p301_071|that's just the way the game is evolving.
p301_072|michael is putting on a brave face.
p301_073|hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p301_074|the next thing will be cutting journey times.
p301_075|it's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p301_076|this is a mental challenge.
p301_077|their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p301_078|he accused the prime minister of dithering.
p301_079|without approval the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p301_080|ferguson did not hesitate.
p301_081|he came in an army uniform.
p301_082|however within those figures income from overseas visitors increased.
p302_033|i've taken to the hills.
p302_034|my game is in pretty good shape.
p302_035|how come it is so often unnoticed?
p302_036|i wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p302_037|we used to keep our business rates.
p302_038|it's a delightful idea but a distancing one.
p302_039|all of us do.
p302_040|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p302_041|it could have been just a quick fix.
p302_042|we are looking for volunteers.
p302_043|theatre is not a museum.
p302_044|subs not used mcculloch.
p302_045|whatever the final decision one thing is certain.
p302_046|he could face a jail sentence.
p302_047|they don't take you to mass graves.
p302_048|what's it got to do with art?
p302_049|happily we found it in the library.
p302_050|i know a lot of people who don't.
p302_051|there was nobody on the roof.
p302_052|he served in the gulf the falklands and northern ireland.
p302_053|we have to reinforce the pressure on iraq.
p302_054|it is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p302_055|the days of empty promises are over.
p302_056|henry was strong and talented.
p302_057|i wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p302_058|we must improve our relations with the government.
p302_059|within six minutes they were two goals down.
p302_060|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p302_061|martin johnson the england captain was back and commanding.
p302_062|he said it was the worst possible result.
p302_063|the quality of life is difficult for them.
p303_036|nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p303_037|others may be trying to catch up.
p303_038|it was a crucial moment.
p303_039|we gave everything we had.
p303_040|i let go the telephone and ran.
p303_041|for one thing he was growing far too quickly.
p303_042|his charisma is all on the course.
p303_043|this is purely financial.
p303_044|i will not be in dialogue with her.
p303_045|our dispute is with the company not the travelling public.
p303_046|i did not want any damage to us.
p303_047|it was an easy decision to come here.
p303_048|i didn't know the company all that well or the dancers.

p303_069|manager neil cooper revealed yesterday.
p303_070|repayment is not part of the game.
p304_043|for these people the ruling is very welcome.
p304_044|scottish sport was not mentioned.
p304_045|i was doing a charity concert.
p304_046|you have to have a sense of humour.
p304_047|it is not about changing our image.
p304_048|we are waiting for advice on the film.
p304_049|i hadn't been looking after myself.
p304_050|his father said my son was lucky.
p304_051|but they also came with a downside.
p304_052|she was only doing her job.
p304_053|are you listening all saints?
p304_054|and then came the seventies.
p304_055|i guess it is down to focus.
p304_056|i'm very angry about it.
p304_057|i have great respect for all my players.
p304_058|his track record is not promising.
p304_059|for a moment it was all about her.
p304_060|sadly the game will never see his like again.
p304_061|trading places was too obvious.
p304_062|they don't know how to do it.
p304_063|no details were disclosed.
p304_064|mrs anderson said this one was different.
p304_065|if you can get away with it you do it.
p304_066|first is open defiance.
p304_067|you probably have never seen them before.
p304_068|clearly audiences are unsettled.
p304_069|we have avoided that at least.
p304_070|i love a clever reader.
p304_071|i do not believe they are.
p304_072|that is completely against islam.
p304_073|clearly there will have to be changes.
p304_074|smuggling is an increasing problem for the government.
p304_075|i will wait until later.
p304_076|but of course it isn't.
p304_077|we are almost at that point but not quite.
p304_078|whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p304_079|could it be?
p304_080|it is bad news for us and england.
p304_081|they had failed to explode.
p304_082|we're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p304_083|i am happy to play for aberdeen.
p304_084|nor should there have been.
p305_043|he stands on centre court alone.
p305_044|both reports appeared in the british medical journal.
p305_045|there was a fine line to tread.
p305_046|they receive a high profile in the media.
p305_047|they were urged to get themselves in order.
p305_048|i've been asked that already this morning on the radio.
p305_049|here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305_050|but don't expect an easy ride.
p305_051|in this case the farmer had actually given permission.
p305_052|some us embassy staff have left the country.
p305_053|her mother said she fell off a swing.
p305_054|we see little sign of improvement.
p305_055|the study carried out by the consumer magazine which?
p305_056|ten years on that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p305_057|for example they could be in school uniform.
p305_058|this film will be totally awesome.
p305_059|three further cases were confirmed yesterday in scotland.
p305_060|there is no mandate for a regime change.
p305_061|he did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305_062|that tells you something about them.
p305_063|the father was treated like a criminal and why?
p305_064|this rule is archaic.
p305_065|i am a drug addict.
p305_066|i've had to take time off work today.
p305_067|this wasn't just a big crowd.
p305_068|i wondered about changing back to rugby.
p305_069|donald dewar was passionate about his politics.
p305_070|however consumers may take a different view.
p305_071|nancy is not sure how she feels.
p305_072|how do you resurrect a dying town?
p305_073|i've put my own money into this project.
p305_074|i've come here for the jersey.
p305_075|it's been a terrible ordeal for margaret.
p305_076|i'm so proud of my team.
p305_077|that would open the gates of hell.
p305_078|this has not and has been neglected.
p305_079|waiting times for these services are too long.
p305_080|if you're a national company you must provide it all.
p305_081|in the event it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p305_082|but they must serve their sentence in scotland.
p305_083|however it is much bigger than that.
p305_084|this season has been great for me it's been an experience.
p306_035|someone came down and said can you read a script?
p306_036|he said he now intends to fly today.
p306_037|this means that our programme is quite unusual.
p306_038|mexico city was a wonderful experience.
p306_039|a further police inquiry is currently being held.
p306_040|some people begin to turn away to go home.
p306_041|you're not stopping people using sunbeds.

p306_057|england and wales are likely to pull out.
p306_058|mr cook a left winger from britain would be ideally replaced.
p306_059|he was taken ill in december last year.

p306_065|his rival's are spoken with elan.
p306_066|he also does not get on with christina.
p306_067|if convicted they face the death penalty.
p306_068|how things have changed since then.
p306_069|therefore it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p307_044|tourism in scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p307_045|it's like if he's all right we will go with him.
p307_046|she added it is the same story in both countries.
p307_047|lara is very very much a girl.
p307_048|i try not to expect anything.
p307_049|lord sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p307_050|there will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p307_051|it was however the wrong side.
p307_052|she is now planning a visit.
p307_053|it also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p307_054|here he is in effect appointing himself a judge.
p307_055|today we begin to answer that question.
p307_056|no it wasn't supposed to do that officials admitted.
p307_057|i keep my fingers crossed.
p307_058|the encounter was to change his life.
p307_059|it's the best of both worlds.
p307_060|they have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p307_061|that is why we want this decision reversed.
p307_062|it didn't work against sweden but that was the intention.
p307_063|staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p307_064|we tried everything but it just wasn't to be today.
p307_065|after this the exercise was due to begin.

p307_067|i want my country to be a republic not an empire.
p307_068|celtic connections is here again and the great debate.
p307_069|i'm just feeling very tired but it's great.
p307_070|when he took over it really took off.
p307_071|that's just the way the game is evolving.
p307_072|michael is putting on a brave face.
p307_073|hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p307_074|the next thing will be cutting journey times.
p307_075|it's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p307_076|this is a mental challenge.
p307_077|their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p307_078|he accused the prime minister of dithering.
p307_079|without approval the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p307_080|ferguson did not hesitate.
p307_081|he came in an army uniform.
p307_082|however within those figures income from overseas visitors increased.
p307_083|cars are great for going long distances.
p307_084|it was published yesterday on the internet.
p307_085|i knew he would play two weeks ago.
p308_043|theatre is not a museum.
p308_044|subs not used mcculloch.
p308_045|whatever the final decision one thing is certain.
p308_046|he could face a jail sentence.
p308_047|they don't take you to mass graves.
p308_048|what's it got to do with art?
p308_049|happily we found it in the library.
p308_050|i know a lot of people who don't.
p308_051|there was nobody on the roof.
p308_052|he served in the gulf the falklands and northern ireland.
p308_053|we have to reinforce the pressure on iraq.
p308_054|it is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p308_055|the days of empty promises are over.
p308_056|henry was strong and talented.
p308_057|i wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p308_058|we must improve our relations with government.

p308_060|ms mcneill was killed on impact.
p308_061|martin johnson the england captain was back and commanding.
p308_062|he said it was the worst possible result.
p308_063|the quality of life is difficult for them.
p308_064|both these events occurred on wednesday night.
p308_065|it is just part of modern day life.
p308_066|a young briton had a lucky escape.
p308_067|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p308_068|you thought it was a headache.
p308_069|i hope we can put it behind us.
p308_070|but it was to no avail.
p308_071|there is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p308_072|i'm thinking what would be easier?
p308_073|that alibi is now gone.
p308_074|we actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p308_075|he now lives in edinburgh with his wife caroline.
p308_076|you do have a way out.
p308_077|it is simple really.
p308_078|i cannot believe she has been admonished.
p308_079|i was in jail for five years.
p308_080|you the british people are the boss.
p308_081|a spokesman for lothian and borders police said.
p308_082|pr for westminster is their holy grail.
p308_083|they won the trophy in the hoops.
p308_084|i never won a penny throughout my career.
p310_043|that argument has been won.
p310_044|normally they have been a pack of lies.
p310_045|he moved back to edinburgh where he lived with his mother.
p310_046|and who would argue with that?
p310_047|i hope you will leave it at that.
p310_048|we're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p310_049|they had four children together.
p310_050|again that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p310_051|lothian and borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p310_052|i fell to the ground.
p310_053|they said she had been visiting her son who is unemployed.
p310_054|they were not defeated.
p310_055|alcohol of course is strictly forbidden in iran.
p310_056|how can they engage with the work?
p310_057|all of us know it exists.
p310_058|moray council could not be contacted last night.
p310_059|this is the band.
p310_060|she has a wonderful mind.
p310_061|there are just two tournaments remaining.
p310_062|we're into that build up now.
p310_063|it is the end of an era.
p310_064|we shall not do that.
p310_065|i have had no social life at all.
p310_066|hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p310_067|once again he refused.
p310_068|this is about the orange order.
p310_069|in fact they will not be disciplined.
p310_070|we're not the tourist board.
p310_071|sub not used mckenzie.
p310_072|apart from that they would not be making any comment.
p310_073|the commons is too outdated.
p310_074|overall though it has been a pretty good week.
p310_075|that was then and this is now.
p310_076|both will be heard at glasgow sheriff court.
p310_077|europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p310_078|are you watching liverpool?
p310_079|he would be with his peers.
p310_080|they seem to be backing off from that.
p310_081|but it took a lot of bottle.
p310_082|they don't work anymore anyway.
p310_083|i wish they too would get a grip.
p310_084|i am so sorry.
p311_043|i knew my contract was up this year.
p311_044|i am content with the silver.
p311_045|people acted too quickly.
p311_046|my heart is with the artist.
p311_047|that fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311_048|there are different cultures in different departments.
p311_049|what would you do if you didn't work?
p311_050|they are already on the way there.
p311_051|the shadow chancellor is away on holiday.
p311_052|this is a holy place.
p311_053|we will miss him very much.
p311_054|as a nation we must become more active.
p311_055|they should go ahead as normal.
p311_056|at the moment michael is in a class of his own.
p311_057|it ended as it began in confusion.
p311_058|i just went a bit too far.
p311_059|i am delighted for simon.
p311_060|his third goal was superb.
p311_061|i don't have a problem with getting older.
p311_062|it has been declared.
p311_063|sure that already happens in new zealand.
p311_064|the scientific debate is dead.
p311_065|only one got through.
p311_066|in the end however it all came together.
p311_067|he is a visionary.
p311_068|i was the trial judge in both.
p311_069|i have a choice.
p311_070|it happens in many countries.
p311_071|it's not just about the shows.
p311_072|but the cost to his health was enormous.
p311_073|i have spoken to the skipper.
p311_074|already the children are dying.
p311_075|craig is a major concern for us.
p311_076|we don't do this for everyone of course.
p311_077|i can't wait to meet him.
p311_078|the pain was almost too much to bear.
p311_079|it's the same as glasgow.
p311_080|we've got a job to do.
p311_081|you just have to adjust.
p311_082|well that's just a third district.
p311_083|i've done nothing wrong and that's the truth.
p311_084|they are there to help us.
p312_043|i think it must be the uniforms.
p312_044|this is not a monument to the past.
p312_045|i certainly hope not.
p312_046|however there could be more bad weather to come.
p312_047|i feel pretty good.
p312_048|the group will report back in the summer.
p312_049|back then it was hard to refuse.
p312_050|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p312_051|i was in the zone in the morning.
p312_052|we have to break that cycle.
p312_053|in fact it might just be the beginning.
p312_054|the children are being very brave.
p312_055|they have a car and cannot afford another.
p312_056|my only concern is for my children.
p312_057|this is welcome news.
p312_058|the criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p312_059|the trust has no magic wand.
p312_060|we just wish they had done so before.
p312_061|it was a virus.
p312_062|the rest of course is history.
p312_063|they chose the latter.
p312_064|i've not said anything to them they know.
p312_065|all were later allowed home.
p312_066|will you just put it away?
p312_067|i think it's more important to have fun.
p312_068|who did the recruiting?
p312_069|it is still with ministers.
p312_070|the effect was almost magical.
p312_071|it happened again and again and again.
p312_072|it showed him the way to drive.
p312_073|i am still waiting for a reply.
p312_074|after this they were always in the driving seat.
p312_075|were they under age?
p312_076|he was charged with perjury.
p312_077|i started it but then forgot all about it.
p312_078|however there would be no permanent displays.
p312_079|the goal will come.
p312_080|he could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312_081|we didn't take our chances.
p312_082|it was all very proper and civilised.
p312_083|i've played them all in the champions league.
p312_084|there are many children.
p313_043|we are not moving in.
p313_044|we have not had a formal request.
p313_045|i never had a childhood.
p313_046|its effect on humans is not yet known.
p313_047|we offered something different.
p313_048|we were very much a happy family.
p313_049|he was critically ill in hospital last night.
p313_050|my brother's buried under there.
p313_051|their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p313_052|what were they?
p313_053|it was large enough to fit the wall.
p313_054|he will be judged by his actions.
p313_055|her role in it was small.
p313_056|i've really noticed that this week.
p313_057|we might be back next year.
p313_058|in a way he was.
p313_059|it's back to how it used to be.
p313_060|it is not a standing army.
p313_061|the firm was down and almost out.
p313_062|they said they were only young men.
p313_063|i was chosen to do this.
p313_064|i learned a lot from that.
p313_065|the house was so well alight.
p313_066|he got his degree.
p313_067|sandy was very active.
p313_068|however there is great potential in this right.
p313_069|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p313_070|i'm confident of the outcome this week.
p313_071|there were no formal announcements.
p313_072|before the games it was pretty open.
p313_073|it really has left the town in shock.
p313_074|but you can go beyond that condition.
p313_075|i'm so worried about the roads.
p313_076|this was much worse.
p313_077|he was convicted at glasgow sheriff court.
p313_078|we are confident of taking that back.
p313_079|they must be kept on the ground.
p313_080|did they give any good advice?
p313_081|who wants to be a millionaire?
p313_082|this does not help.
p313_083|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p313_084|that's why the ministers resigned.
p314_043|i'm delighted with how he has come through.
p314_044|in fact he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
p314_045|he will emerge as a world leader.
p314_046|that view has not altered.
p314_047|i only half believe it.
p314_048|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p314_049|all the oil companies are talking together.
p314_050|we have no choice but to shut down.
p314_051|i'm feeling pretty good.
p314_052|the prognosis is excellent.
p314_053|rangers deserved to beat us.
p314_054|that though is the measure of the man.
p314_055|it was developed in the gulf war.
p314_056|sub not used mackay.
p314_057|it is not normal practice.
p314_058|but he just carried on anyway.
p314_059|the spirit in the squad is certainly good.
p314_060|what happens next?
p314_061|i would not want to be young again.
p314_062|meanwhile the search continues for ferguson's replacement.
p314_063|i'm astonished the men were not injured.
p314_064|there are schoolboys in uniform.
p314_065|except this time it seems he really really means it.
p314_066|they were later discharged from hospital.
p314_067|let's see that increase over the years.
p314_068|i've learned a lot and tomorrow is another day.
p314_069|they knew they shouldn't have been there.
p314_070|these findings would be made public.
p314_071|it's the most beautiful place on earth.
p314_072|i think overall they were the best team in the tournament.
p314_073|you can't go on forever.
p314_074|all the lads are totally focused on that.
p314_075|so far this season this approach is working.
p314_076|i have got a knife.
p314_077|if you don't enforce it you bring it into disrepute.
p314_078|what did we learn?
p314_079|i go home only once.
p314_080|i'm not going to answer that right now.
p314_081|it had a gigantic effect.
p314_082|on that basis he would set it aside.
p314_083|i like many others will consider where we go from here.
p314_084|bin laden was not mentioned.
p316_044|the question is will it be enough?
p316_045|after that it is up to the boss.
p316_046|they were taken to prove a point.
p316_047|it doesn't have to be in inverness.
p316_048|and they removed a borderer.
p316_049|so why does he do it?
p316_050|i would love to have him home.
p316_051|it is very unfair and something should be done.
p316_052|he had no enemies.
p316_053|that is not the case this time.
p316_054|we are going to new broomfield to win.
p316_055|but the law is very clear on this.
p316_056|they treated me with respect and courtesy.
p316_057|there was only silence.
p316_058|however he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p316_059|it doesn't look as pretty.
p316_060|however our players will fight for that.
p316_061|everyone was very saddened.
p316_062|he declined to give further details.
p316_063|he said it was for sale.
p316_064|this is a dream come true.
p316_065|the problem is not confined to the uk.
p316_066|i wouldn't give them a grade.
p316_067|what on earth is wrong with you?
p316_068|this is far too high.
p316_069|we are still going ahead with our plans.
p316_070|is tony blair on drugs?
p316_071|and if he hadn't become a musician?
p316_072|it has certainly paid off for him.
p316_073|he was also a great man.
p316_074|we have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316_075|it is clear that change is required.
p316_076|thirty schools were closed in the western isles.
p316_077|this is a big step up.
p316_078|robin williams is subdued.
p316_079|the judge was very nice.
p316_080|they control the prices paid to farmers.
p316_081|the company yesterday refused to comment.
p316_082|most of them have already gone home.
p316_083|worse still he might be singing lady in red.
p316_084|weaknesses there are however.
p316_085|it is after all a very funny play.
p317_043|had she enjoyed the experience?
p317_044|i feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p317_045|she had travelled to spain to give evidence.
p317_046|i would think they are just behind them.
p317_047|we then went to see the headmaster.
p317_048|as far as we are concerned he is innocent anyway.
p317_049|there is no mandate for a regime change.
p317_050|he did the right thing by ignoring me.
p317_051|these men are a part of india.
p317_052|are we going to stay up?
p317_053|sub not used mcculloch.
p317_054|i am going home to see my children.
p317_055|new potential dangers were emerging.
p317_056|that tells you something about them.
p317_057|the father was treated like a criminal and why?
p317_058|i am a drug addict.
p317_059|i've had to take time off work today.
p317_060|the problem is the book.
p317_061|there was no basis for their arrest.
p317_062|this wasn't just a big crowd.
p317_063|i wondered about changing back to rugby.
p317_064|they say he wants to go to england.
p317_065|they are the partner of choice for anyone.
p317_066|donald dewar was passionate about his politics.
p317_067|wagner was never like this.
p317_068|it is an attitude of mind.
p317_069|how do you resurrect a dying town?
p317_070|and what does it cost and who is paying?
p317_071|i've come here for the jersey.
p317_072|this is not an optional extra.
p317_073|this is not the most crucial issue.
p317_074|we don't know much but we are still awaiting news.
p317_075|it's that sort of night.
p317_076|morale is very high despite the growing risks.
p317_077|will we ever play together again?
p317_078|it's been a terrible ordeal for margaret.
p317_079|i played well but missed a few chances.
p317_080|that must be left to the parole board.
p317_081|i'm so proud of my team.
p317_082|they have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p317_083|that would open the gates of hell.
p317_084|this has not and has been neglected.
p318_045|i never had a childhood.
p318_046|its effect on humans is not yet known.
p318_047|we offered something different.
p318_048|we were very much a happy family.
p318_049|he was critically ill in hospital last night.
p318_050|my brother is buried under there.
p318_051|their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p318_052|what were they?
p318_053|it was large enough to fit the wall.
p318_054|he will be judged by his actions.
p318_055|her role in it was small.
p318_056|i have really noticed that this week.
p318_057|we might be back next year.
p318_058|in a way he was.
p318_059|it's back to how it used to be.
p318_060|it is not a standing army.
p318_061|the firm was down and almost out.
p318_062|they said they were only young men.
p318_063|i was chosen to do this.
p318_064|i learned a lot from that.
p318_065|the house was so well alight.
p318_066|he got his degree.
p318_067|sandy was very active.
p318_068|however there is great potential in this right.
p318_069|we have no idea what caused the derailment.
p318_070|i am confident of the outcome this week.
p318_071|there were no formal announcements.
p318_072|before the games it was pretty open.
p318_073|it really has left the town in shock.
p318_074|but you can go beyond that condition.
p318_075|i'm so worried about the roads.
p318_076|this was much worse.
p318_077|he was convicted at glasgow sheriff court.
p318_078|we are confident of taking that back.
p318_079|they must be kept on the ground.
p318_080|did they give any good advice?
p318_081|who wants to be a millionaire?
p318_082|this does not help.
p318_083|i've invented a village in east lothian.
p318_084|that's why the ministers resigned.
p318_085|he has lost confidence and weight.
p318_086|this process of attrition is expected to continue.
p323_043|now they have found out the truth.
p323_044|we've still got a say in this.
p323_045|the first was excluding sinn fein.
p323_046|horses are drawn by ballot.
p323_047|we have our supporters and our enemies.
p323_048|mackie was at home unable to watch.
p323_049|so what's it about?
p323_050|we have been let down by these people.
p323_051|what's it for?
p323_052|nor does he have any desire to be.
p323_053|how well did they get on?
p323_054|i don't think it is a drawback.
p323_055|he doesn't need to be told he knows the truth.
p323_056|they may have been murdered.
p323_057|however this weekend it will be different.
p323_058|we didn't try hard enough that is all.
p323_059|it also condemned the suicide bombers.
p323_060|i think that's a bit of an invasion.
p323_061|it is very difficult.
p323_062|this is the place to play football.
p323_063|but it was a great decision he joked.
p323_064|then they killed another three.
p323_065|what the department of transport will make clear.
p323_066|the six others were injured.
p323_067|most of the others were in their twenties.
p323_068|we were beaten by the better team today.
p323_069|you need a long term strategy in football.
p323_070|they are not the answer to staff shortages.
p323_071|the law has got to be upheld.
p323_072|advice and counselling will be offered.
p323_073|i mean they have just been a disaster.
p323_074|he's a joy to follow.
p323_075|that is my personal view.
p323_076|he had just returned to thailand from canada.
p323_077|i saw the explosion and panicked.
p323_078|the protest will go ahead as planned.
p323_079|the punishment was swift.
p323_080|who will run the bigger show?
p323_081|general you didn't get a modified.
p323_082|it is a crisis of human rights a crisis of leadership.
p323_083|these things just happen.
p323_084|and within itself it is visionary.
p326_040|the police believe the man was not injured.
p326_041|it would be a miracle.
p326_042|we just love to chat.
p326_043|i read about it in the newspapers.
p326_044|what did they think of her voice?
p326_045|they say they feel different.
p326_046|it is a good result for great britain.
p326_047|what on earth is wrong with you?
p326_048|we will continue to pressure the government.
p326_049|his art was not just about emotions.
p326_050|they are all bright and different.
p326_051|i found a fault and worked at it.
p326_052|my position on the euro is quite clear.
p326_053|labour was too busy to respond.
p326_054|his voice is strong.
p326_055|they may yet have the last laugh.
p326_056|but they add up.
p326_057|you can feel at home in china.
p326_058|it is the wealthiest in europe.
p326_059|this is all part of opening the door.
p326_060|yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p326_061|mr blunkett was convinced.
p326_062|for the other parties it is back to business as usual.
p326_063|he will become the sovereign.
p326_064|it was a foolhardy decision.
p326_065|washington is consumed by the crisis.
p326_066|now suddenly we have this new landscape.
p326_067|there is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p326_068|everyone could see it apart from kevin keegan.
p326_069|for the meantime though the signs are good.
p326_070|messages have to be reinforced.
p326_071|the success story shows no signs of stopping.
p326_072|another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p326_073|the insider opens tomorrow.
p326_074|more patience and composure was required.
p326_075|it is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p326_076|i was shocked and outraged.
p326_077|it's just gotten too big.
p326_078|we're still in talks and hopefully they will continue.
p326_079|i am immensely proud of them.
p329_043|that argument has been won.
p329_044|normally they have been a pack of lies.
p329_045|i hope you will leave it at that.
p329_046|we're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p329_047|the bill would be massive.
p329_048|he was just a journalist.
p329_049|they said she had been visiting her son who is unemployed.
p329_050|thames valley police decided not to prosecute.
p329_051|i didn't have a clue.
p329_052|how can they engage with the work?
p329_053|i have been coming here for nine years.
p329_054|she has a wonderful mind.
p329_055|there are just two tournaments remaining.
p329_056|we're into that build up now.
p329_057|it is the end of an era.
p329_058|i have had no social life at all.
p329_059|hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329_060|in short the club was broke.
p329_061|his charisma is all on the course.
p329_062|i am still pretty young in this business.
p329_063|on saturday it was much the same.
p329_064|we're not the tourist board.
p329_065|it was the same old story.
p329_066|apart from that they would not be making any comment.
p329_067|the commons is too outdated.
p329_068|you are going to glasgow airport and not coming back.
p329_069|what happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329_070|it was not the greatest performance but it was effective.
p329_071|europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329_072|partly but only partly this is their own fault.
p329_073|he would be with his peers.
p329_074|they seem to be backing off from that.
p329_075|this will be no easy option.
p329_076|i wish they too would get a grip.
p329_077|i am so sorry.
p329_078|this avalanche is just beginning.
p329_079|it is a pity but you can't have everything.
p329_080|we will see how he is after treatment.
p329_081|i was there for five hours.
p329_082|but then he changed his mind.
p329_083|i don't know why she is not here.
p329_084|they are currently managed by ian wilson.
p333_044|nobody else was with me.
p333_045|however the report was incorrect.
p333_046|it does make a big difference.
p333_047|do not forget about monaco.
p333_048|peter of course refuses to conform.
p333_049|you can't give in to the vandals.
p333_050|everything was an effort.
p333_051|and does it even matter?
p333_052|this is the same old story.
p333_053|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p333_054|my parents are exhausted.
p333_055|no it wasn't supposed to do that officials admitted.
p333_056|the performance was excellent.
p333_057|alright it was a defeat but it felt like a victory.
p333_058|the overall effect is impressive but distancing.
p333_059|it will come up here.
p333_060|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p333_061|yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333_062|the chief constable is right.
p333_063|i didn't expect to get one.
p333_064|it has been blown out of all proportion.
p333_065|this is only the start of my season.
p333_066|it sounded awfully like panic.
p333_067|i've taken to the hills.
p333_068|john was a very nice man.
p333_069|this is a big big win.
p333_070|the crowd was awesome.
p333_071|every game against new zealand is.
p333_072|the jury is still out on this one.
p333_073|my game is in pretty good shape.
p333_074|that would have killed the match.
p333_075|still the experience was amazing she says.
p333_076|i wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p333_077|they had not been handcuffed.
p333_078|i think we will join the single currency.
p333_079|then it was the turn of the carnival.
p333_080|but the tragedy did not stop there.
p333_081|they wanted to show what they could do.
p333_082|it runs until the beginning of june.
p333_083|all of us do.
p333_084|but will they fall in love?
p333_085|it was different from our other work.
p334_043|the offer of help is there for anyone.
p334_044|there were no passengers on board.
p334_045|and we're not there yet.
p334_046|no meaningful response was issued.
p334_047|and the funny thing is they usually do.
p334_048|times have changed but have they improved?
p334_049|iain duncan smith is a decent man.
p334_050|we feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334_051|later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334_052|it is a form of physical exercise.
p334_053|plays in dark blue.
p334_054|but by that time of course it is again.
p334_055|it is something that we will put right.
p334_056|why do it?
p334_057|it could take three days.
p334_058|hopefully it will be built by next year.
p334_059|it was totally my fault.
p334_060|or so everyone believed.
p334_061|it was served by sheriff officers not by the council.
p334_062|perhaps we should do the same.
p334_063|tomorrow night is the important game.
p334_064|he's very good at relating to adults.
p334_065|he is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334_066|every aspect of our play was first class.
p334_067|every school in scotland should be excellent.
p334_068|it was a move which appealed to him.
p334_069|there is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p334_070|he will need that machine.
p334_071|but there are problems such as retraining new staff.
p334_072|we are looking for volunteers.
p334_073|i had a sense of deja vu.
p334_074|it was very personal and very intimate.
p334_075|by this point the couple were approaching fast.
p334_076|i was inspired by two things.
p334_077|they follow him everywhere.
p334_078|i couldn't make out what was going on.
p334_079|maybe that was the whole point.
p334_080|the feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334_081|they just thought it was extremely good acting.
p334_082|so we said no we're not going to do that.
p334_083|this must be really short of ideas.
p334_084|it was extremely cold.
p335_044|the failings are serious.
p335_045|the prognosis is excellent.
p335_046|rangers deserved to beat us.
p335_047|that though is the measure of the man.
p335_048|on reflection it is more than that.
p335_049|it is not normal practice.
p335_050|but he just carried on anyway.
p335_051|they couldn't believe what had happened.
p335_052|i would not want to be young again.
p335_053|meanwhile the search continues for ferguson's replacement.
p335_054|the yugoslav army will still be there.
p335_055|there are schoolboys in uniform.
p335_056|i don't want to hear any excuses.
p335_057|they were later discharged from hospital.
p335_058|let's see that increase over the years.
p335_059|i've learned a lot and tomorrow is another day.
p335_060|these findings would be made public.
p335_061|it's the most beautiful place on earth.
p335_062|i think overall they were the best team in the tournament.
p335_063|i've learned from my mistakes.
p335_064|this must be wrong.
p335_065|he added later normally it's not a dangerous river.
p335_066|it probably didn't feel anything she added.
p335_067|i go home only once.
p335_068|i am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
p335_069|it is a family day out.
p335_070|on that basis he would set it aside.
p335_071|i like many others will consider where we go from here.
p335_072|bin laden was not mentioned.
p335_073|seven people were later detained by police.
p335_074|the team this year is going places.
p335_075|we should do everything at a stroke.
p335_076|he had a moustache.
p335_077|it's just for me.
p335_078|history is usually written by the victors.
p335_079|it plans to return to this field.
p335_080|he said because people had invited him.
p335_081|that would be dangerous.
p335_082|its workforce is to be made redundant.
p335_083|we aim to put them out of business.
p335_084|they're completely different from each other.
p335_085|he was extremely nervous.
p336_042|i should say so.
p336_043|yet therein is the problem.
p336_044|this isn't a new problem.
p336_045|that though was just the start of it.
p336_046|my office is down there.
p336_047|there can be no dispute about our history.
p336_048|the crowd was waiting.
p336_049|it was a joy.
p336_050|it's the same with cinema.
p336_051|it was the climax of the thing.
p336_052|he died from multiple injuries.
p336_053|it is nearly there.
p336_054|i'm going to buy a car.
p336_055|we said what do you mean?
p336_056|i have been there many times.
p336_057|the crackdown is launched today by the government.
p336_058|this ruling is a farce.
p336_059|they enjoy playing the game.
p336_060|it was rather a distorted image of islam.
p336_061|it is not standing army.
p336_062|it was a crucial moment.
p336_063|someone else has now got them.
p336_064|the second is freedom.
p336_065|i let go the telephone and ran.
p336_066|get used to it.
p336_067|for one thing he was growing far too quickly.
p336_068|everyone at the school is delighted for steven.
p336_069|after that the scottish parliament will run the show.
p336_070|sadly in this case that was not so.
p336_071|the hearing was continued until a later date.
p336_072|still some additions are inspired.
p336_073|any error is severely punished.
p336_074|yet what is supposed to be said?
p336_075|but we will learn from that.
p336_076|he has not created a festival resource.
p336_077|we couldn't afford it.
p336_078|i get the bus.
p336_079|i might have been sitting at home with her out here.
p336_080|frankly we should all have such problems.
p336_081|the issues are not going to change.
p336_082|four minutes later the show was over.
p336_083|would you have ever believed that was possible?
p339_043|i said to him.
p339_044|labour has been found out on public spending.
p339_045|he told a producer.
p339_046|that is not the place for her.
p339_047|the jury is still out on this one.
p339_048|we have to work together.
p339_049|i don't think that he won't be released.
p339_050|it is a hard act to follow the winning act.
p339_051|it means it is difficult.
p339_052|but they were true stories.
p339_053|i needed to get away.
p339_054|i will make that point tonight.
p339_055|tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339_056|there are two things we have to do.
p339_057|are they going to work together again?
p339_058|we need to do that every week.
p339_059|it gives us something to work on.
p339_060|but what did it matter?
p339_061|a government is a government is a government.
p339_062|hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339_063|i am not retaining him.
p339_064|the police are not the target.
p339_065|it has affected it obviously.
p339_066|but that title is a mistake.
p339_067|and he's not a bigot.
p339_068|but summer is spent.
p339_069|services are being expanded too.
p339_070|it has only been rumours.
p339_071|it is extremely fortunate.
p339_072|today is the first step in that process.
p339_073|several others were absent.
p339_074|it is surprising to come back this way.
p339_075|but there was no time for that.
p339_076|a review is under way.
p339_077|that should be fun.
p339_078|maybe he will act again.
p339_079|what we were doing.
p339_080|what is the barnett formula?
p339_081|it all happened so suddenly.
p339_082|i won't let that happen.
p339_083|or have they?
p339_084|there is no change in the strategy.
p340_044|that was a month ago.
p340_045|i have lost all confidence.
p340_046|it would be another reason to live.
p340_047|i felt under a lot of pressure.
p340_048|none of the pieces was commissioned.
p340_049|it is somewhere to be.
p340_050|but it was no problem.
p340_051|this has been a difficult time for me.
p340_052|these people are not big names.
p340_053|don't you believe it.
p340_054|i certainly think it's very short sighted.
p340_055|we did something about it.
p340_056|where is the money coming from?
p340_057|it needs a rethink.
p340_058|why does it work?
p340_059|he would have been wrong.
p340_060|he played really really well.
p340_061|he was right of course.
p340_062|it's there for people to look at.
p340_063|together we can make a difference.
p340_064|that however was the exception.
p340_065|this has been a long process.
p340_066|it's a lovely lovely film.
p340_067|it's probably just as well.
p340_068|it is time for the talking to stop.
p340_069|we were very close.
p340_070|if only it were so.
p340_071|they do not deliver.
p340_072|however that is just for starters.
p340_073|this can be extreme.
p340_074|i'm sure that they will learn.
p340_075|would she remember the music?
p340_076|there was still more disquiet in israel.
p340_077|two options are being proposed.
p340_078|mr masterton said he was very hopeful.
p340_079|he is now back in britain.
p340_080|there was no commission.
p340_081|there was a vacuum.
p340_082|it is time to be realistic.
p340_083|everyone in front of me was dead.
p340_084|willie deserved it for what he has achieved.
p340_085|it is a potential danger.
p341_041|he was arrested but later released without charge.
p341_042|i fell into it by accident.
p341_043|ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p341_044|this is a big advantage.
p341_045|her daughter is getting married.
p341_046|moray council could not be contacted last night.
p341_047|if you have to pay for treatment you pay for treatment.
p341_048|all the lads are totally focused on that.
p341_049|today is not about contracts.
p341_050|that says something for his strength of character.
p341_051|we are going for it.
p341_052|you see it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p341_053|it's to do with play.
p341_054|however the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p341_055|i've just got to do this.
p341_056|it's not of course a concert hall.
p341_057|so the process was refined.
p341_058|labour accused the tory leader of panicking.
p341_059|i know when my time is it doesn't bother me.
p341_060|i think it is a sensible change.
p341_061|sex is fun?
p341_062|they were not doing it too well either.
p341_063|he added it's not a racial problem.
p341_064|this is the crossroads.
p341_065|he had played well in that central role.
p341_066|he is pretty upset.
p341_067|and who would argue with that?
p341_068|where is the human rights?
p341_069|we must put a marker down.
p341_070|the decision is an absolute disgrace.
p341_071|now just two games into the season he has gone.
p341_072|it is time to give her a rest.
p341_073|they had had time for little else.
p341_074|the feeling is awesome.
p341_075|we have reports of this throughout scotland.
p341_076|but there was a shift.
p341_077|the settlement could run to millions.
p341_078|it does not stop at the border.
p341_079|we've always had three options and none of them are perfect.
p341_080|he released a half dozen solo albums.
p341_081|robert is a special talent.
p343_041|we were with him the whole time.
p343_042|that was the theory anyway.
p343_043|we've all been here before.
p343_044|i had troubles with the producers.
p343_045|so it took me back to boarding school.
p343_046|he died the following year.
p343_047|that's what we're trying to achieve.
p343_048|he is trying really hard.
p343_049|i have no doubt about that.
p343_050|it is a beautiful country.
p343_051|i expect a rapid response.
p343_052|there was still more disquiet in israel.
p343_053|this was never a support group.
p343_054|i must take a seat.
p343_055|my mother is a widow.
p343_056|being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p343_057|thankfully there were no reports of anything serious.
p343_058|the matter will come up again.
p343_059|i don't believe in gesture politics.
p343_060|the decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343_061|he should be a great asset.
p343_062|but that's another story for another day.
p343_063|one thing is sure.
p343_064|he has really done well.
p343_065|i'm just delighted to take it.
p343_066|this happened on three days inside a week.
p343_067|funding needs to be long term.
p343_068|it's funny how it comes and goes.
p343_069|it was just awful.
p343_070|that is really all.
p343_071|we played too deeply.
p343_072|we could have got three medals.
p343_073|i am ready to go.
p343_074|we are still suffering from that.
p343_075|the script was funny.
p343_076|we are at the crossroads.
p343_077|i am about protecting the state pension.
p343_078|they were at school together.
p343_079|i am looking forward to getting home.
p345_040|rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p345_041|you've got to be vigilant.
p345_042|you can see how he made his money.
p345_043|however there were some alarming findings.
p345_044|who wants to be a millionaire?
p345_045|we would certainly consider the proposals.
p345_046|i haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345_047|his record with england was not good.
p345_048|the opposite is the case.
p345_049|who would be a referee?
p345_050|suddenly it was indeed a new ball game.
p345_051|it was time to act.
p345_052|it's a question of fashion.
p345_053|i could never be cool.
p345_054|we will be paying agency rates.
p345_055|others said he had gone too far.
p345_056|we expect them to deliver for us.
p345_057|he was between people and god.
p345_058|i've never seen anything like it.
p345_059|they were willing us to get a second.
p345_060|no casualties were reported.
p345_061|the classes are taking place.
p345_062|if true it will be the first sign of dissent.
p345_063|the sleeper was six hours late.
p345_064|there will be no threat to the game.
p345_065|it would be a last resort.
p345_066|that is part of athletics.
p345_067|who would have known.
p345_068|we were caught out.
p345_069|it will include the black watch the royal highland regiment.
p345_070|i haven't made any definite decisions.
p345_071|i had to lie.
p345_072|among them is his beloved teacher.
p345_073|everyone was writing me off.
p345_074|how do we get more people in?
p345_075|the defender made an impressive debut.
p345_076|but her parents will never see her again.
p345_077|saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p345_078|i have nothing to lose.
p345_079|he would have loved it.
p347_044|it does make a big difference.
p347_045|how many cases have there been?
p347_046|peter of course refuses to conform.
p347_047|you can't give in to the vandals.
p347_048|the old firm are going nowhere.
p347_049|everything was an effort.
p347_050|and does it even matter?
p347_051|george mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p347_052|my parents are exhausted.
p347_053|no it wasn't supposed to do that officials admitted.
p347_054|alright it was a defeat but it felt like a victory.
p347_055|if he does not leave he will be shot.
p347_056|my thoughts are with their families.
p347_057|it will come up here.
p347_058|from our point of view the player is free to leave.
p347_059|yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p347_060|it is a very special city.
p347_061|this is only the start of my season.
p347_062|the message is just not getting through.
p347_063|it sounded awfully like panic.
p347_064|i've taken to the hills.
p347_065|this is a big big win.
p347_066|the crowd was awesome.
p347_067|my game is in pretty good shape.
p347_068|we were given a break.
p347_069|he already had had complaints.
p347_070|how come it is so often unnoticed?
p347_071|i wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p347_072|thankfully mr campbell was able to help.
p347_073|they had not been handcuffed.
p347_074|i think we will join the single currency.
p347_075|then it was the turn of the carnival.
p347_076|you have to rely on each other.
p347_077|one thing is certain.
p347_078|we cannot ask for them back.
p347_079|it's a delightful idea but a distancing one.
p347_080|no one said anything to me.
p347_081|all of us do.
p347_082|that is in the public domain.
p347_083|the hague is too good for him.
p347_084|on fuel the chancellor has a number of options.
p347_085|in just a fortnight however everything has changed.
p351_043|he is keen to stay in public service.
p351_044|who are the democrats?
p351_045|you had to go and see him.
p351_046|what did you learn in school today?
p351_047|we know we can defend it.
p351_048|that is not the case.
p351_049|he met his wife and married in england.
p351_050|instead we were shot in the back.
p351_051|this isn't a gimmick.
p351_052|i won't go back.
p351_053|there is no signature on this document.
p351_054|we could not compete with rangers.
p351_055|there was mystery back then.
p351_056|we're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p351_057|now it has become a big picture.
p351_058|the jury is still out.
p351_059|hopefully they will not go through with it.
p351_060|they have been very lucky with the ice.
p351_061|we are not the first to be affected.
p351_062|my players are special.
p351_063|we are the gateway to justice.
p351_064|the devil is in the detail.
p351_065|his handling raises a wider issue.
p351_066|we have got the school holidays on.
p351_067|we can't go home.
p351_068|that just wasn't good enough.
p351_069|the working families tax credit is far better.
p351_070|those who are preparing to give up.
p351_071|it's really good as long as we play well.
p351_072|i feel alive and good today.
p351_073|she was married with one son.
p351_074|there may be some work in construction but not enough.
p351_075|it was a pretty terrible day.
p351_076|his track record is impressive.
p351_077|clearly it is very disturbing.
p351_078|it is tough but possible.
p351_079|this youngster is so exciting
p351_080|i don't understand it.
p351_081|the band was good and it's been a great day.
p351_082|he was rejected because he had retired.
p351_083|i just wanted to get off the course.
p351_084|she was also very brave.
p360_043|that has now gone.
p360_044|donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
p360_045|this will take up to nine months.
p360_046|and maybe they have.
p360_047|next league matches dundee united rangers.
p360_048|is he conscious?
p360_049|but we are confident.
p360_050|it is like a football team.
p360_051|when he came to see me on monday.
p360_052|that's a concern to me.
p360_053|she said she was really sorry.
p360_054|that will be important.
p360_055|but here it is also very bad.
p360_056|that view has not altered.
p360_057|it was very full anyway.
p360_058|as for the warning it was not needed.
p360_059|the incidents are not believed to be linked.
p360_060|but there is no easy option.
p360_061|i can't believe she is dead.
p360_062|no person was charged.
p360_063|but it would say that.
p360_064|most of the works are small in scale.
p360_065|he was pronounced dead at the scene.
p360_066|only the bomber was killed.
p360_067|but he just carried on anyway.
p360_068|nor was it a game without its lessons.
p360_069|it was that kind of afternoon.
p360_070|his presence was very important.
p360_071|what happens next?
p360_072|they couldn't believe what had happened.
p360_073|the bombing begins in five minutes.
p360_074|that took two weeks.
p360_075|it's worth it though.
p360_076|that perhaps is behind the problem.
p360_077|i have to hand it to the bank.
p360_078|the question was simple enough.
p360_079|the voters rejected us.
p360_080|there was a definite prejudice.
p360_081|nothing is going right at the moment.
p360_082|we never publicise it.
p360_083|you will be very welcome.
p360_084|his musicals were very much of their time.
p361_043|so we have to go back.
p361_044|i'm sure he does.
p361_045|he was found again almost a year later.
p361_046|the answer was wrong.
p361_047|they need to be helped.
p361_048|it is all starting to come together.
p361_049|i am the fastest player on the course.
p361_050|it is the tip of the iceberg.
p361_051|they were taken to prove a point.
p361_052|it doesn't have to be in inverness.
p361_053|it is an important step forward.
p361_054|a final agreement has not yet been completed.
p361_055|and they removed a borderer.
p361_056|that is the way it is.
p361_057|that was something else.
p361_058|this resulted in the following.
p361_059|i want to deal with this stuff.
p361_060|we will be patient but we will win.
p361_061|as good as they come.
p361_062|it is not for me to say.
p361_063|for that much we must be grateful.
p361_064|but the law is very clear on this.
p361_065|i thought it was quite a positive result.
p361_066|but we are very near.
p361_067|nobody else is at risk.
p361_068|we are not going to back off.
p361_069|he said it was for sale.
p361_070|we have a strong team at the moment.
p361_071|this is a dream come true.
p361_072|the problem is not confined to the uk.
p361_073|it is on the news.
p361_074|they said there was nothing.
p361_075|they were looking for things.
p361_076|i've got to be better than that quite.
p361_077|i wouldn't give them a grade.
p361_078|as it should be.
p361_079|we have never been short of volunteers.
p361_080|but who is it?
p361_081|kenny miller might come through.
p361_082|workers will now be balloted on the offer.
p361_083|it just isn't there.
p361_084|drama is not one of them.
p362_043|they were impressive against france.
p362_044|this is only one example.
p362_045|his style is suited to scottish football.
p362_046|the cause is just.
p362_047|i am so upset.
p362_048|england could not take anything for granted however.
p362_049|they finished second and third.
p362_050|but this was refused.
p362_051|meanwhile the action is spreading to eastern europe.
p362_052|hasn't let anyone down?
p362_053|we've always had three options and none of them are perfect.
p362_054|we certainly hope we have been successful.
p362_055|he is one of them.
p362_056|this was no accident.
p362_057|he is a law unto himself.
p362_058|it is a sign of hope.
p362_059|with him are the symbols of his faith.
p362_060|they're interested only in profits.
p362_061|and there has been a good start.
p362_062|i feel my parents are in new york.
p362_063|policing the profession is important.
p362_064|seems a sensible compromise.
p362_065|she had no chance.
p362_066|in the meantime you just have to get on with it.
p362_067|i don't have a problem with it.
p362_068|how is he enjoying life as a senior?
p362_069|it's more relaxing this way.
p362_070|allison is not convinced.
p362_071|we have to move forward from now on.
p362_072|and it was this one.
p362_073|i am going to win the next two.
p362_074|she's afraid of life.
p362_075|but there is good and bad.
p362_076|the real problem is the usher hall.
p362_077|that is her job.
p362_078|they have broken that promise.
p362_079|i don't know what it means.
p362_080|i found the course inspiring.
p362_081|i have to accept that.
p362_082|it means the margin for error is tight.
p362_083|i thought he was part of the camera.
p362_084|she is now on the back benches.
p363_042|there is a new confidence about the club.
p363_043|his film is not.
p363_044|it is the strength of the school.
p363_045|in my experience he does not do that.
p363_046|that is good news.
p363_047|this has come as a shock to everyone.
p363_048|he will never be forgotten.
p363_049|i was not overly concerned about this.
p363_050|he was very grateful for his health.
p363_051|the nation has his music.
p363_052|but real life is not like that.
p363_053|so now we know.
p363_054|that is why this action has been taken.
p363_055|who will pay for this?
p363_056|the defender should have won the bloody ba.
p363_057|there has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
p363_058|we were upset about the referee.
p363_059|that is our objective.
p363_060|what's the problem?
p363_061|he is not alone.
p363_062|he did that last sunday.
p363_063|there wasn't anything in it.
p363_064|the club is afflicted by injuries.
p363_065|sentencing is also being considered in that review.
p363_066|lovely day isn't it?
p363_067|it was far from business as usual.
p363_068|thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p363_069|the show is not over.
p363_070|saddam hussein is a devil.
p363_071|this is a judgment issue.
p363_072|thirty people have applied for his job
p363_073|it was just an accident.
p363_074|we are not commenting at the moment.
p363_075|today we must not repeat that mistake.
p363_076|somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p363_077|he is slightly confused.
p363_078|we did not deserve to go through.
p363_079|the course has helped a lot.
p363_080|all the time that number was coming down and down.
p363_081|there is room for me.
p363_082|that can only be a good thing.
p363_083|i have never seen anything like this.
p364_031|but at the moment there isn't the budget.
p364_032|it is not a matter of concern.
p364_033|we're not either of those things.
p364_034|the man has already had too many chances.
p364_035|it shouldn't be a problem.
p364_036|it was very moving actually.
p364_037|it isn't a free for all.
p364_038|pensions have been hitting the headlines.
p364_039|i was not fit enough and it showed.
p364_040|i thought it was the only way out.
p364_041|we welcome the ministers decision.
p364_042|since then it has become a tradition.
p364_043|the concept is simple.
p364_044|that is how the farmer is feeling today.
p364_045|and that's the trouble with this business.
p364_046|so what did he do?
p364_047|we must not give in to bastards.
p364_048|the trial will open today.
p364_049|but it didn't happen.
p364_050|what do you think they said?
p364_051|there will be no disruption in the schools.
p364_053|i can live with that.
p364_054|there is no doubt about that.
p364_055|the president took offence.
p364_056|our commitment is to move forward.
p364_057|partly it is his own fault.
p364_058|that's where it all started.
p364_059|the family is so happy for him.
p364_060|why has it taken so long?
p364_061|no one knows the numbers.
p374_043|i still hope to go.
p374_044|does that put pressure on us?
p374_045|as a player you have to move on.
p374_046|it is so out of character.
p374_047|i am inclined to play it down.
p374_048|however it's good to turn the page.
p374_049|his condition was serious but stable.
p374_050|he had reason to be pleased.
p374_051|we have a problem.
p374_052|i find it puzzling and disturbing.
p374_053|that alibi is now gone.
p374_054|but the cost to his health was enormous.
p374_055|i suspect the latter.
p374_056|however in orkney there was a mixed response.
p374_057|it is simple really.
p374_058|the net is closing.
p374_059|i cannot believe she has been admonished.
p374_060|that took a long time to happen.
p374_061|it was on fire.
p374_062|this year the exercise is being repeated.
p374_063|nobody did in those days.
p374_064|you the british people are the boss.
p374_065|where is the discipline?
p374_066|we were very much a happy family.
p374_067|they won the trophy in the hoops.
p374_068|this time it is official.
p374_069|it's going to be epic.
p374_070|she could easily have been killed.
p374_071|yesterday one from aberdeen was postponed.
p374_072|i didn't mean to kill her.
p374_073|we're just a family working hard working seven days a week.
p374_074|that money could have been coming to scotland.
p374_075|i'd love to do another olympics.
p374_076|what method of funding is being used?
p374_077|it is not a standing army.
p374_078|this is a great day.
p374_079|he got his degree.
p374_080|i'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p374_081|and their remit is limited.
p374_082|i have great respect for all my players.
p374_083|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p374_084|there is no question of dithering.
p376_030|suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p376_031|so if we can take anything from tonight it will be fantastic.
p376_032|we want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p376_033|because we do not need it.
p376_034|it's a matter of balance.
p376_035|and we have a singer.
p376_036|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p376_037|he has not been named.
p376_038|it is a matter of the utmost concern to the allies.
p376_039|they have now been banned from celtic park for life.
p376_040|it was clear.
p376_041|it is urgent.
p376_042|a neighbour said.
p376_043|we need to chat.
p376_044|we're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p376_045|it's the same old story.
p376_046|that should do it.
p376_048|the whole of southern africa is in the grip of aids.
p376_049|a recording contract is on the horizon.
p376_050|it has been a horrible horrible time.
p376_051|he looks like an afghan.
p376_052|they had to explain it.
p376_053|however he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p376_054|but the law is very clear on this.
p376_055|we were surprised to see the photograph.
p376_056|next league matches celtic.
p376_057|sadly it can't.
p376_058|this is a step backwards.
p376_059|it will take time.
