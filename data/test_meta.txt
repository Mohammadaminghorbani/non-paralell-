p259_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p259_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p259_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p259_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p259_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p259_025|but it could prove disastrous.

p276_033|their courage and their honesty should be respected.
p276_034|he said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
p276_035|there was a rush of water.
p276_036|a fiver and i'll tell.
p276_037|we speak about the performance.
p276_038|she is employed on short term contracts.
p276_039|further management changes are planned.
p276_040|i can feel the sound inside.
p276_041|nonetheless the overall picture is healthy.
p276_042|he is married with three children.
p276_043|i might well have done so already.
p276_044|this is slightly negative for inflation.
p276_045|and they had a case.
p276_046|we believe a third party was involved.
p276_047|mr darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p277_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p277_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.

p277_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p277_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p277_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p277_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p277_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p277_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p277_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p277_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p277_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p277_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p277_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p277_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p277_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p277_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p277_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p277_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p277_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p277_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p277_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p277_025|people come into the borders for the beauty of the background.
p277_026|is this accurate?
p277_027|they have no history.
p277_028|their courage and their honesty should be respected.

p277_032|he was jailed for five years.
p277_033|mr ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p277_034|we must provide a long term solution to tackle this attitude.
p277_035|then suddenly they weren't.
p277_036|was it worth it?
p277_037|other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p277_038|however they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p277_039|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p277_040|they're just different.
p277_041|two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack.
p277_042|a quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p277_043|indeed he does.
p277_044|i did not see any reason to change the captain.
p277_045|he's just in it for himself.
p277_046|however the decision has been welcomed by scottish enterprise officials.
p277_047|it is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p277_048|we will push.
p277_049|charlie gordon leader of the council dismissed the suggestion.

p277_066|we need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p277_067|i feel i did not have enough time.
p277_068|the rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p277_069|george robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p277_070|they are real.
p277_071|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p277_072|that was a gold medal for certain.
p277_073|he was popular.
p277_074|but i've won both ways.
p277_075|there was an e mail.
p277_076|sounds like the sixth sense?
p277_077|strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p277_078|painful but only because it's true.
p277_079|i had my suspicions.
p277_080|he was at home with his pals.
p277_081|it was magic.
p277_082|the first minister is scheduled to be elected by the parliament tomorrow.
p277_083|it is a job creation scheme.
p277_084|the guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p277_085|even the one she loved.
p277_086|today she has been released.
p277_087|he is in the queue.
p277_088|he liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p277_089|what would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p277_090|otherwise it will cost a lot of money.
p277_091|someone who cares
p277_092|by then he was walking on water.
p277_093|it just shows the arrogance of labour and the liberal democrats.
p277_094|it is a blow.
p277_095|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p277_096|they lived for their children.
p277_097|downing street will make the second appointment in the scotland office today.
p277_098|today i couldn't run on it.
p277_099|this time it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p277_100|i was a spectator that is as far as it goes.

p277_120|it is so sad.
p277_121|the mood is upbeat.
p277_122|it is rubbish.
p277_123|that was the lesson to be learned from the european championships.
p277_124|there will be a beginning a middle and an end.
p277_125|who would have?
p277_126|there were no grounds for his action.
p277_127|i can't even get into the a team.

p277_165|i've put my own money into this project.
p277_166|councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p277_167|it is not like us.
p277_168|we've all had the shots.
p277_169|it's hard enough for a father anyway and i was forever grateful.
p277_170|again we were lucky.
p277_171|yet it is unlikely to be either full or final.
p277_172|does that put pressure on us?
p277_173|it's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p277_174|they might be broken but they are not defeated.
p277_175|as we worked.
p277_176|tony had arrived.
p277_177|and she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.

p277_192|on the outside of an airport it is very difficult.
p277_193|tommy is not a problem.
p277_194|i would think about the end of january the beginning of february.
p277_195|but she might be.
p277_196|i in the meantime had been far from chilling.
p277_197|it was worth a photograph.
p277_198|they make a selective perception process.
p277_199|we have an election in eight days.
p277_200|even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p277_201|this gives a financial incentive to switch.
p277_202|the proposals are to be debated on monday by city councillors.
p277_203|twaddle is a case in point.
p277_204|a grampian police spokesman said.
p277_205|he sees a difference in the style of the two teams.

p277_213|at the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p277_214|you should always be able to get out in some direction.
p277_215|it's not before time.
p277_216|the report is due out next month.
p277_217|but she was.
p277_218|jim wallace the justice minister acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p277_219|at the time he was a living legend.
p277_220|they must do it.
p277_221|dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
p277_222|however no further action was taken by police.
p277_223|until they came to do it.
p277_224|half of young people had had contact with the police.
p277_225|well they were the unlucky ones.
p277_226|there is no excuse.
p277_228|on the ground the west bank was again the focus of violence.
p277_229|but it's a subtle process.
p277_230|he also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p277_231|attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p277_232|in fact it is deeply unpleasant.
p277_233|a thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in europe.
p277_234|it is hard won.
p277_235|our policy is clear.
p277_236|the scene is about this?
p277_237|the project has already secured the support of sir sean connery.
p277_238|there wasn't a goal.
p277_239|i should think so too.
p277_240|there's the mix.
p277_241|the concerns are the same.
p277_242|i can't get a job.
p277_243|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p277_244|it is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p277_245|however it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p277_246|one mp said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p277_248|is that a serious question?
p277_249|this is the first step.
p277_250|they must play for each other.
p277_251|souter will be back.
p277_252|george w bush the us president condemned the attacks.

p277_257|he claimed his insurance company contested the damages not the restaurant.
p277_258|immediate action must be taken.
p277_259|it's very nice.
p277_260|he was also married with two children.
p277_261|the system can work.
p277_262|it depends on the internal discussions in the ministry of defence.
p277_263|we're in shock.
p277_264|our objective is to tackle poverty.
p277_265|it's a way of life.
p277_266|the decision was announced at its annual conference in dunfermline.
p277_267|it was very fast.
p277_268|the record companies have gone through the floor.
p277_269|he has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p277_270|in fact he was talking about the survival business.
p277_271|if not he should go home.
p277_272|it is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p277_273|he looked very sharp.
p277_274|there was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p277_275|all options are open.
p277_276|dialogue is the key.
p277_277|they have shown a great desire and attitude.
p277_278|it was a virus.
p277_279|maloney is an engaging talent.
p277_280|the condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p277_281|this is a national crisis.
p277_282|it was good.
p277_283|who did the recruiting?
p277_284|bombing slaughter rejected
p277_285|the songs are just so good.
p277_286|the goals will come.
p277_287|there's a pause.
p277_288|that might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p277_289|i was the sheep.
p277_290|what has altered?
p277_291|i was brought up in a mining background.
p277_292|nothing is safe.
p277_293|it would still have been a good film but very different.
p277_294|one was a lawyer.
p277_295|the most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p277_296|they are wrong.
p277_297|violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p277_298|the plot is minimal.
p277_299|you are the glory.
p277_300|however he is a coach and he remains a coach at heart.
p277_301|the letters are going out today.
p277_302|we want to play at the worlds.
p277_303|he is also keen to win the european order of merit.
p277_304|my whole life has changed.
p277_305|we are a peaceful people.
p277_306|you may have a short memory.
p277_307|it will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p277_308|my body is clearly capable.
p277_309|plans to celebrate the queen's golden jubilee will proceed.
p277_310|it is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p277_311|a review is under way.
p277_312|it will work.
p277_313|i came into this world with nothing.
p277_314|it's too horrible to think.
p277_315|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p277_316|off with their heads.
p277_317|is there a new way forward?
p277_318|i was invited to work in germany.
p277_319|is that an issue?
p277_320|later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p277_321|you have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p277_322|the same things will happen with gm foods.
p277_323|i would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p277_324|it sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p277_325|well it won't.
p277_326|these days are long gone.
p277_327|two people were interviewed.
p277_328|i've got no secret.
p277_329|the package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p277_330|we lost our composure towards the interval he said.
p277_331|in the early days i was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p277_332|yet for my money he was not the man of the match.
p277_333|a formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p277_334|this is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p277_335|he loves the big occasions.
p277_336|the performance was excellent.
p277_337|that has been lost.
p277_338|tell us about it.
p277_339|he met mr davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p277_340|she said they would appeal.
p277_341|a spokeswoman for edinburgh city council confirmed its support for the company.
p277_342|another case of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in scotland yesterday.
p277_343|both of those promises have already been honoured.
p277_344|in addition it was in breach of natural justice.
p277_346|as indeed they would be.
p277_347|it is the holiday programme with a mortgage.
p277_348|to do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p277_349|we will be homeless.
p277_350|six of the asylum seekers left the offices it was reported.
p277_351|mr anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p277_352|obviously we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p277_353|there was a substantial explosion.
p277_354|not so it seems.
p277_355|he could make it.
p277_356|four policemen were wounded.
p277_357|we have to create a climate of trust which is not easy.
p277_358|it's now down in black and white.
p277_359|now though he has an incentive.
p277_360|anything is possible in football and we can beat celtic again.
p277_361|they have not done so this season so far.
p277_362|this big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p277_363|it took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p277_364|so there we won.
p277_365|by that time however it was already too late.
p277_366|there is no signature.
p277_367|it was a funny game.
p277_368|he was the architect.
p277_369|i'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p277_370|i've never seen a game like it.
p277_371|i am a wealthy person.
p277_372|whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p277_373|he's delighted too with the new premises.
p277_374|the cabinet is split over the issue.
p277_375|something is wrong.
p277_376|you can cope with it.
p277_377|i didn't know that i had a court appearance on wednesday.
p277_378|that's the name of the game though.
p277_379|since then he has played no active part in the company.
p277_380|star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p277_381|family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p277_382|at the last i found a bunker.
p277_383|yet the data is compelling.
p277_384|one day he threw the baby against a wall.
p277_385|it's a real problem.
p277_386|on the contrary it was actually very funny.
p277_387|i was in the train station overnight.
p277_388|it is unusual.
p277_389|the charity also has a project in moscow in russia.
p277_390|it's like a basketball.
p277_391|well it did last time he was reminded.
p277_392|i love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p277_393|the compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p277_394|it was a kind of contempt.
p277_395|it was a breathtaking moment.

p316_031|naturally she said yes.
p316_032|this is not a war on terror.

p323_031|its role is not to interfere.
p323_032|leisure centres were also affected.
p323_033|something happened on that island.
p323_034|meantime the department is proposing structural changes.
p323_035|last year it was won by jack mcconnell the first minister.
p323_036|it is misleading to compare the two.
p323_037|they discussed how he might get involved.
p323_038|and this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
p323_039|and it had two seats.

p330_029|that was their attitude.
p330_030|it was nothing to do with my daughter.
p330_031|the problem in norway is outside the national.
p330_032|mr crawford is no stranger to scottish enterprise.
p330_033|and it had two seats.
p330_034|they could move in at any moment.
p330_035|there were no reported injuries.
p330_036|i haven't spoken to anyone about that not even my wife.
p330_037|jock brown is appointed as general manager.
p330_038|it is my nature.
p330_039|or so she thought.
p330_040|thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p330_041|this advice was accepted by ministers.
p330_042|we did not even get a free kick.
p330_043|what was going through her mind that day that night?
p330_044|our decision making was poor.
p330_045|last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p330_046|they said we were out of touch.
p330_047|in the meantime the fans would settle for a derby win.
p330_048|it is bad news for the flooded areas.
p330_049|he moved back to edinburgh where he lived with his mother.
p330_050|there will be widespread support on all sides.
p330_051|this was the classical period of beethoven.
p330_052|he has one son and one daughter.
p330_053|i was never going to play against scotland.
p330_054|any error of judgment was ruled out.
p330_055|scotland had great assets.
p330_056|we shall not forget him.
p330_057|and thought we would get away with it.
p330_058|i think they should have more respect.
p330_059|yesterday mr hague dismissed the poll.
p330_060|this is a big club.
p330_061|i find it rather oppressive.
p330_062|many many people don't know who he is.
p330_063|nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p330_064|one the acute services trust will run the general hospital services.
p330_065|we have to expand.
p330_066|others may be trying to catch up.
p330_067|we gave everything we had.
p330_068|i think it is a release of tension.
p330_069|this is a most serious matter.
p330_070|i let go the telephone and ran.
p330_071|it is also very valuable.
p330_072|we're trying to lessen the stigma.
p330_073|over time with patience and precision the terrorists will be pursued.
p330_074|this makes up for it.
p330_075|this is purely financial.
p330_076|i want to help other women.
p330_077|the problem is labour.
p330_078|the way ahead is not easy.
p330_079|i could do a better job.
p330_080|i will not be in dialogue with her.
p330_081|an announcement will follow in due course.
p330_082|i am here to play football.
p330_083|our dispute is with the company not the travelling public.
p330_084|that is the crunch.
p330_085|i did not want any damage to us.
p330_086|four minutes later the show was over.
p330_087|it was an easy decision to come here.
p330_088|i didn't know the company all that well or the dancers.
p330_089|however you have just got to adjust to it.
p330_090|everything has the potential to be serious.
p330_091|charles kennedy had an effective outing.
p330_092|everything will fall into place it should be fine.
p330_093|this will be great for the young lads.
p330_094|he needed seven hours of surgery.
p330_095|who said impatience is a virtue?
p330_096|what do we do for an encore?
p330_097|jim wallace justice minister has refused to hold an inquiry.
p330_098|many other scottish locations also feature.
p330_099|there's nothing for the kids.
p330_100|creative expressive football was the order of the day.
p330_101|obviously someone is not doing their job properly.
p330_102|the feeling is marvellous.
p330_103|an internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p330_104|it was more like a labour party rally.
p330_105|the conductor too will have adjustments to make.
p330_106|in essence the teaching profession has a choice.
p330_107|i'm astonished the men were not injured.
p330_108|the partnership was set up during the summer.
p330_109|gerhard schroeder was the victor.
p330_110|the money is not really our concern.
p330_111|you just know it.
p330_112|wallace was in at the deep end.
p330_113|don't say you have not been warned.
p330_114|some were close to tears.
p330_115|seven children had lost both parents.
p330_116|so how will it be received in the us?
p330_117|the government was consulting interested parties he added.
p330_118|above all he was knocked out by the choir.
p330_119|there will always be someone somewhere willing to undercut on price.
p330_120|who then is going to be captain of europe?
p330_121|certainly the taliban regime is finished.
p330_122|some people still think she should be english.
p330_123|manager neil cooper revealed yesterday.
p330_124|repayment is not part of the game.
p330_125|who will perform?
p330_126|it's like a high school play.
p330_127|he was part of south africa.
p330_128|it's much more dynamic.
p330_129|the party will make up its own mind.
p330_130|what do they pay to join the club?
p330_131|two people are allowed to share the duty.
p330_132|they want to avoid a flashpoint.
p330_133|we are now in a safe place.
p330_134|she goes to the opening of an envelope.
p330_135|the reason of course was iraq.
p330_136|it will be very useful for us.
p330_137|he was obviously very genuine.
p330_138|we told them in july.
p330_139|it's like a garage.
p330_140|he will be judged by his actions.
p330_141|no briton has ever won.
p330_142|the answer is with ourselves.
p330_143|that is the last thing they need.
p330_144|was society doing enough?
p330_145|the results are sometimes contentious.
p330_146|i never thought it would take this long.
p330_147|he changed my life.
p330_148|there was nothing else to match it.
p330_149|i was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p330_150|it is in other words entrapment by another name.
p330_151|they have worked with each other.
p330_152|o is there a lot of blood?
p330_153|disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p330_154|that will alter the dynamics of scottish politics.
p330_155|his parenthood is called into question.
p330_156|audacious decisions were taken early on.
p330_157|but it could have been written for her.
p330_158|his only reply was a laugh.
p330_159|i'm really looking forward to it.
p330_160|a report will be issued by march.
p330_161|we're just a family working hard working seven days a week.
p330_162|the party lasted all night.
p330_163|i was delighted with every one of them.
p330_164|sure the coe is a cracking band.
p330_165|at the time of watching however it is totally convincing.
p330_166|it was horrible but there is still more.
p330_167|i was proud of our lads.
p330_168|so too eriksson as yet unbeaten on his travels with england.
p330_169|this is not a scottish problem.
p330_170|it was his twenty first birthday on monday.
p330_171|there were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p330_172|after that we made some changes.
p330_173|these things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p330_174|he didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p330_175|scotland were beaten again.
p330_176|glasgow is a tour de force.
p330_177|i have no battle with the scots.
p330_178|the league of nations was also his idea.
p330_179|i've done it almost like a variety show.
p330_180|he urged mr blair to get out more.
p330_181|she is on a life support machine.
p330_182|the actor has met with mandela.
p330_183|euro the single currency is a fact.
p330_184|this is a dream come true for me.
p330_185|the election is total confusion and chaos.
p330_186|i think it'll be a great occasion.
p330_187|he went to see what he could learn.
p330_188|it's such a beautiful place like a palace in italy.
p330_189|a board of inquiry has already been convened.
p330_190|we're not an employment agency.
p330_191|it has all been positive.
p330_192|referees are easy targets.
p330_193|it's not one or the other you have to have both.
p330_194|no government has that right.
p330_195|the luxury has been well used.
p330_196|urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p330_197|billie was yet to be born.
p330_198|she died in hospital two hours later.
p330_199|today however half of them get this financial help.
p330_200|this is a good result for them.
p330_201|we think all other measures are not exhausted.
p330_202|there was no time scale.
p330_203|our message was inclusive.
p330_204|she was right about the struggle.
p330_205|only the scale of change differed.
p330_206|that was one very hard game.
p330_207|i think the euro has slipped.
p330_208|we began to walk down.
p330_209|i will not take you out of context.
p330_210|winning meanwhile is headed back to new york city.
p330_211|the cold war is over.
p330_212|i'd like to take the plunge.
p330_213|there is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p330_214|lately that market has come under pressure.
p330_215|it had to be more flexible.
p330_216|we are not far from a deal.
p330_217|are there muscular problems?
p330_218|you remember how long he lasted?
p330_219|last night she refused to comment on the accident.
p330_220|ordering online was very easy.
p330_221|i didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p330_222|however sharon rejected the claims.
p330_223|i think it is a great idea.
p330_224|after about a year the feeling returned to my finger.
p330_225|but it's just great to have won.
p330_226|we're going to see more extreme weather.
p330_227|suddenly the rugby world had changed.
p330_228|all these women were actors.
p330_229|i've got no secret.
p330_230|we talk about mr michael johnson and he is awesome.
p330_231|craig is still suffering seizures.
p330_232|what happened to me last week was wrong.
p330_233|i never made any offer to mark.
p330_234|to a level which we consider appropriate.
p330_235|that is the first thing we need.
p330_236|will they ever reopen?
p330_237|after that date the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p330_238|we have great team spirit.
p330_239|above all the aggression must be stopped.
p330_240|a national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
p330_241|we have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
p330_242|you would fall over he said.
p330_243|we have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p330_244|they should take their mobile phones.
p330_245|he loved his job and working in newspapers.
p330_246|mr finnie however said his hands were tied.
p330_247|they are also exploited by the markets.
p330_248|the principle is quite clear.
p330_249|talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p330_250|the board of governors must act.
p330_251|we must all play our part.
p330_252|i first met him last summer.
p330_253|it was to be published next month.
p330_254|that is a break with tradition.
p330_255|otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p330_256|it could have been a hammering by now.
p330_257|last night the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p330_258|here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p330_259|subs not used fernandez.
p330_260|the question is is that a negative?
p330_261|this would discourage investment and job creation.
p330_262|i played really well on the back nine.
p330_263|last week he was taken into hospital.
p330_264|he will decide tomorrow.
p330_265|it was tough but we did have a lot of possession.
p330_266|over the last four years we have been fairly consistent.
p330_267|that end is enjoying life as far as david is concerned.
p330_268|but clearly it is crucial to understand that point.
p330_269|mary is as it were the cause of her mother's death.
p330_270|that is our main aim.
p330_271|for this government reform and resources go together.
p330_272|i always knew she was funny.
p330_273|however many of their victories have been close affairs.
p330_274|all kinds of things occur.
p330_275|mentally you have to be tough.
p330_276|i expected these kind of questions.
p330_277|the film has also been superbly designed.
p330_278|it was fit for royalty.
p330_279|it is always the same isn't it?
p330_280|who would take it now after all this?
p330_281|i felt really good until friday.
p330_282|except this time it seems he really really means it.
p330_283|i am confident of the outcome this week.
p330_284|equity declined to comment.
p330_285|there is precious little middle ground.
p330_286|she was shouting my baby my baby.
p330_287|he later became a respected high court judge.
p330_288|they were both delightful to work with.
p330_289|it's my delight on a shiny night.
p330_290|if convicted they face the death penalty.
p330_291|it's now down in black and white.
p330_292|twaddle is a case in point.
p330_293|arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p330_294|just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p330_295|there were no formal announcements.
p330_296|for now we must take one game at a time.
p330_297|that was quite an interesting part.
p330_298|breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p330_299|motion described it as a unique event.
p330_300|we have to offer value for money.
p330_301|the eye was badly closed on sunday.
p330_302|chris is big and jolly.
p330_303|it is quite an eye opener.
p330_304|it became a national network.
p330_305|they still have the dirty work to do.
p330_306|i do not want to wait until may.
p330_307|the festival idea has been a great success.
p330_308|we really need research to help with that.
p330_309|we all work for nothing.
p330_310|it is extremely popular with families.
p330_311|he will do very well.
p330_312|it was a cry for help.
p330_313|they also intend to travel today.
p330_314|there's a lot of hysteria.
p330_315|the casualties were not named.
p330_316|for athletes in our current climate their sport is their livelihood.
p330_317|axis itself was created from that exercise.
p330_318|florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p330_319|it's just that we see different things.
p330_320|stevenson was arrested on monday morning.
p330_321|i am very happy with life.
p330_322|we are all family men with children.
p330_323|the committee's remit is far reaching.
p330_324|we've had our problems at the club.
p330_325|the plot is changing as time goes on.
p330_326|they were at her bedside when she died.
p330_327|i think we showed that after half time.
p330_328|building an underground for example has proved a nightmare.
p330_329|i am not in denial.
p330_330|there is a solution she believes.
p330_331|yet the data is compelling.
p330_332|lord levy said he started life with nothing.
p330_333|there was pressure from elsewhere too.
p330_334|what are you waiting for?
p330_335|it could have been just a quick fix.
p330_336|will he be given time?
p330_337|you let a lot of people down.
p330_338|it's annoying in a way.
p330_339|the result today is an impasse.
p330_340|it would have to be backdated.
p330_341|one person was believed to have been hit.
p330_342|it is like being a qualifier again.
p330_343|and he's the first to see that and say that.
p330_344|our biggest threat is the bbc.
p330_345|hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p330_346|she is very upset.
p330_347|we have to learn lessons from these things.
p330_348|it was a poor performance.
p330_349|we are very very proud of alain.
p330_350|that is the consistent approach of the government.
p330_351|there was no sign that anything was amiss.
p330_352|it didn't help him as far as we had seen.
p330_353|head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p330_354|it is patently true.
p330_355|i've got my own ideas.
p330_356|the guys have really enjoyed it.
p330_357|they might want to play.
p330_358|the goal will stay with me forever.
p330_359|our people should be immune.
p330_360|it is simple and easy to use.
p330_361|today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
p330_362|english rugby is on the brink of extinction though it's official.
p330_363|it is the way they work.
p330_364|this was another video cassette.
p330_365|the rear of the plane was on fire.
p330_366|it's a logical consequence of the formula.
p330_367|i think we finished fifth.
p330_368|another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p330_369|we know them as mobile telephones.
p330_370|i have chosen to do this research.
p330_371|that's the law of the land.
p330_372|for the scottish judges the affair is very delicate and unique.
p330_373|he scored a touchdown.
p330_374|he wouldn't do it.
p330_375|i don't know exactly what happened.
p330_376|they were very very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p330_377|we are waiting for them to calm down.
p330_378|the government faces a moral dilemma.
p330_379|and a mightily impressive recording it is too.
p330_380|debate is not just talk.
p330_381|however the second goal was about to be delivered.
p330_382|neither was involved in violence.
p330_383|but because of the wood no one had the experience.
p330_384|so people will come out with these things.
p330_385|it was a very difficult decision for us.
p330_386|i am not a happy man.
p330_387|was it just negligent.
p330_388|that would open the gates of hell.
p330_389|if only we had known.
p330_390|the line up is a tasty one.
p330_391|he was located after going to singapore.
p330_392|she was my big sister.
p330_393|meantime his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p330_394|they will now get that support.
p330_395|mr burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p330_396|then all was revealed.
p330_397|they are interior designers and architects.
p330_398|suspension will come into force at midnight.
p330_399|however there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p330_400|all the teachers are afghan refugees.
p330_401|what's in a name in this the age of the internet?
p330_402|we think a lot of allan mcgregor.
p330_403|they had given up on him.
p330_404|she had travelled to spain to give evidence.
p330_405|we didn't know if people would turn up.
p330_406|we will deal with the refugees.
p330_407|i am greatly encouraged.
p330_408|they offer a kind of narrative.
p330_409|you guys are not out of it yet.
p330_410|what does he want him to look like?
p330_411|you know he was struggling with his game all week.
p330_412|what is next?
p330_413|their welfare is very important to us.
p330_414|it's nothing to do with me.
p330_415|she has now been registered as disabled.
p330_416|you have to work with what you've got.
p330_417|o leary now intends to take a holiday.
p330_418|now however it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p330_419|this is about the orange order.
p330_420|but it looks good for next year.
p330_421|we will do so again.
p330_422|it's been a long long journey.
p330_423|i have no problem with that.
p333_001|please call stella.
p333_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p333_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p333_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p333_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p333_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p333_008|these take the shape of a long round arc with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p333_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p333_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p333_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p333_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p333_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p333_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p333_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p333_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p333_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p333_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.

p361_028|these decisions are not simple.
p361_029|the results were very clear.
p361_030|we must convince the citizens.

p361_034|i am really ready for it now.
p361_035|he was jailed for four years.
p361_036|we felt it was sufficient.

p362_028|i feel really good.
p362_029|it was a fairy tale.
p362_030|but there are no plans.
p362_031|they responded in the most positive way.
p362_032|i have a very strong opinion about this.

p362_039|to beat the european champion is quite nice.
p362_040|they had a confession.

p363_029|he scored one goal and was on fire.
p363_030|his party never arrived.
p363_031|visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
p363_032|if that is the case it is a breakthrough.
p363_033|he gave no other details.
p363_034|it's not an improvement for him.
p363_035|i think it is wide open.
p363_036|it certainly is cause for concern.
p363_037|it's on with a roller.
p363_038|the captaincy will help that too.
p363_039|that's probably the hard bit about being dropped.

p374_029|i'll take the blame for that.
p374_030|and that was just for starters.
p374_031|in order to get there we have got to invest.
p374_032|why did it take a concerted campaign?
p374_033|i will always remember the horrible images.
p374_034|what you sow you have to reap.
p374_035|we are expecting a big crowd.
p374_036|i was contacted this morning.
p374_037|he didn't want me to leave the house.
p374_038|it's not just a challenge for us.
p374_039|but honestly there is no need for us to panic.
p374_040|i've had a ball.
p374_041|treatment is not an issue with these people.
p374_042|you thought it was a headache.
p376_001|please call stella.
p376_002|ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p376_003|six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob.
p376_004|we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p376_005|she can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station.
p376_006|when the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p376_007|the rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p376_008|these take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p376_009|there is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p376_010|people look but no one ever finds it.
p376_011|when a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p376_012|throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p376_013|some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p376_014|to the hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p376_015|the greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p376_016|the norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p376_017|others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p376_018|aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p376_019|since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p376_020|many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p376_021|the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p376_022|the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super imposition of a number of bows.
p376_023|if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p376_024|this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue.
p376_025|it's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p376_026|but it failed.
p376_027|he said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p376_028|we have to pull together or we will hang apart.
p376_029|several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
